      "      \"abstract\": \"This study introduces an innovative approach to wastewater treatment that combines two electrochemical technologies: electrolysis and electrochemical separation facilitated by anionic exchange membranes. This integrated technology converts pollutants into carboxylates, which are valuable intermediates for further electrosynthesis and fuel production. The efficacy of this approach was demonstrated using synthetic wastewater containing phenol as a model pollutant, chosen for its well-documented characteristics that enable comparative analysis with previous studies. The treatment process utilized mixed metal oxides (MMO) anodes with a composition of Ti/(RuO2)0.8(Sb2O4)0.2 and a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode. The investigation was structured to evaluate each component of the treatment system individually before examining their collective performance. Through a series of case studies, the research not only confirmed the feasibility of this innovative technology but also highlighted the need for further study on the optimization of operational parameters and electrode materials. Comparative analysis revealed that MMO anodes outperformed BDD anodes, achieving maximum carboxylate transport rates of 138.7 mmol m\\u22122h\\u22121. The efficiency of carboxylate separation from the solution where they were generated reached up to 54.6 mmol kWh\\u22121, while the maximum overall production efficiency was 8.77 mmol kWh\\u22121. The study further determined that current density significantly affects both the production rate and the extent of mineralization, identifying optimal densities of 100 mA cm\\u22122 and 30 mA cm\\u22122 for the electrolyzer and electroseparator units, respectively. This work provides valuable insights for the optimization of this promising wastewater treatment technology, with potential applications in various industries. \\u00a9 2024 The Author(s)\",\n",

However, its practical application is often challenging due to the complexity of adopting small-scale parameters and identifying all the potential problems during the operation of electrokinetic plants. Here, a prototype demonstration in a space environment (Technology Readiness Level 7) is reported to remediate a 5 \\u00d7 5 m2 plot of a leachate pond from a landfill containing dense sludge contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds. Bench-scale tests (50 kg per mock-up) were initially carried out to evaluate the effects of the key parameters (electric field, surfactants, and electrode materials) and demonstrated the feasibility of reducing contaminant concentrations in the sludge through dehalogenation and volatilisation. The average electro-osmotic flux was 0.23 cm day\\u22121, comparable to that reported for silty soils. Iron electrodes enhanced electrokinetic water transport and reduced acidification, while glassy carbon electrodes increased water volatilisation, acidity near the anode, and dehalogenation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. Based on these findings, the full-scale design and operating conditions were selected. After 590 h of operation, the total pollutant concentration was reduced by 34 %, mainly due to volatilisation, using a sequence of six iron-electrode arrays at 1 V cm\\u22121, which increased the sludge temperature over 60 \\u00b0C. An evaporation rate of 0.021 cm d\\u22121 and an electro-osmotic flux of 0.62 cm d\\u22121 were achieved, consistent with the bench tests. These findings demonstrate the potential of electrokinetic plants for the remediation of sludges and provide expertise applicable to future remediation at other contaminated sites. \\u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",

Therefore, this study focuses on the preparation and performance evaluation of green, non-fluorinated proton exchange membranes in a chlor-alkali-based reversible electrochemical cell system for renewable energy storage applications. The membranes were prepared by casting and cross-linking of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with varying chitosan (CS) concentrations (5\\u201320 wt%), followed by sulfonation using diluted sulfuric acid at room temperature. CS concentrations significantly influenced membrane's physicochemical properties, including ion exchange capacity, ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, and water uptake. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy revealed a correlation between free volume properties and other membrane characteristics. A custom-designed 3D-printed electrochemical cell was developed, capable of operating in reversible mode (both electrolysis and fuel cell modes) with a zero-gap configuration. The PVA/CS (20 wt%) membrane outperformed Nafion, exhibiting a lower voltage (4 V vs. 6 V) in electrolysis mode at 50 mA cm\\u207b2 and a higher specific power density (2.7 vs. 1.9 mW cm\\u207b2 mgPt) in fuel cell mode.

In this work, the co-treatment of real HCH-LL (pre-treated via electro-oxidation (EO)) and urban wastewater using an activated sludge process operated in an anoxic/oxic sequencing batch (A/O-SBR) mode was investigated. EO tests were conducted employing either a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode or a dimensionally stable anode (DSA), resulting in effective HCH isomers removal (>93 % after 20 Ah/L). Chloride-derived by-products (CDBPs) such as free chlorine (up to 828 mg Cl2/L), chlorate (up to 972 mg/L) (formed with EO (DSA)) and perchlorate (up to 1830 mg/L) (with EO (BDD)) persisted after the treatment. EO (DSA) resulted in inhibitory effects (up to 100 % respiration inhibition) on the biological process. Conversely, EO (BDD) negligibly affected biological respiration (up to 20 % less than without pre-treatment), while perchlorate bio-reduction by A/O-SBR was poor (28 %). Acetate addition in pre-treated HCH-LL for perchlorate bio-reduction allowed to achieve simultaneous contaminants removal (> 99 %) and CDBPs reduction (up to 100 %). Biodegradation and bio-adsorption tests without pre-treatment showed partial HCH isomers removal (about 40 %) and poor bio-adsorption. \\u00a9 2024 The Authors\",\n",

This becomes an opportunity for chloralkaline technology in which the quality of water used is lower than the required in other hydrogen production technologies. This work compares the performance of chloralkaline electrolyzers fed with different solutions of NaCl (from brackish water to brines) with that obtained feeding two natural water samples (seawater and porewater) and three processed waters (rejections streams of the electrodialysis, reverse osmosis of the porewater and a real rejection of the reverse osmosis of a vineyard). All tests were made with a lab-scale 3-D printed cell where, in addition, the performance of Ti/RuO2 and Pb/PbO2 anodes were compared, being always better the results obtained in the tests made with the Ti/RuO2 electrode. Results obtained indicate that efficiencies reached using these alternative sources are lower than those which can be reached using synthetic brines that, in turn, were very near to the standards reached in the chloralkaline industry. In the case of hydrogen production, the maximum values were obtained for seawater, reaching efficiencies proximate to 8.0 mg H2 (Wh)\\u22121. Rejection streams of desalination processes were found to be less efficient, attaining values in the range 2 and 4 mg H2 (Wh)\\u22121. Regarding the production of chlorine and caustic soda, better performances were reached again with seawater (161.7 mg Cl2 (Wh)\\u22121 and 0.092 mg OH\\u2212 (Wh)\\u22121) and with the rejection of the electrodialysis, which also reached sound values of 90.4 mg Cl2 (Wh)\\u22121 and 0.107 mg OH\\u2212 (Wh)\\u22121. Results obtained are promising and indicate a path that must be further worked for the implementation of a greener water management strategy in the hydrogen -based energy storage technology. \\u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",

Results demonstrate the effectivity of this technological approach as well as the important effect of the anode material and the irradiation of UVC light. Regarding the first, the choice of BDD coatings lead to a non-selective and extremely efficient degradation of the chlorinated organic compounds (COCs) with a low dependency on the exerted current density. In contrast, MMO coatings exhibit slower and less efficient degradation, with improved degradation results at lower current densities. Regarding the second, as demonstrated in a previous study for the dosing of electrochemically produced hydrogen peroxide, UVC light irradiation not only does not improve but worsen the degradation of the chlorinated hydrocarbons and this is explained by the better predisposition of the target pollutants for being oxidized with molecular oxidant rather than with radicals. This work provides important lessons learned for future applications of the electrochemical technology in the treatment of comparable environmental problems. \\u00a9 2024 The Authors\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Within the new circular economy paradigm, this work evaluates the performance of tailored mixed metal oxides (MMO) anodes, based on ruthenium and antimony, for their application into an electrochemically-assisted organic refinery process. This process is designed to transform pollutants into value-added products with minimal mineralization. Oxidation of synthetic wastes consisting of phenol solutions was used to validate the electrochemical conversion of phenolic wastes into carboxylates, which are then considered as bricks to be used for electrosynthesis or to produce fuels. The MMO anodes were manufactured using two synthesis routes (Pechini method and ionic liquid method), each followed by one of three different heating treatments: furnace, microwave, and CO2 laser. The selection of the optimal electrode for the organic electrorefinery was based on a combination of physical and electrochemical properties, degradation performance of phenol to carboxylates, and long-term stability, looking for a truly sustainable solution. Results indicate that anodes synthesized by the ionic liquid (IL) method, regardless of the heating treatment, demonstrated superior performance, with larger active areas (with furnace 82 mC cm\\u22122, microwave 97 mC cm\\u22122, and laser 127 mC cm\\u22122) and higher phenol degradation rates, resulting in a greater generation of carboxylates during electrolysis, yielding primarily oxalate and achieving up to 40% conversion with furnace heating. However, laser-treated anodes exhibited greater stability than furnace-made ones, attributed to the formation of an insulating TiO2 layer. Although the electrode with the longest service life did not show the best catalytic properties for minimizing mineralization, the observed variations in coatings with identical chemical compositions highlight the importance of this research. This study positions itself at the forefront of developing more efficient and sustainable electrochemical technologies for organic waste treatment. \\u00a9 2024 The Authors\",\n",

Thus, the effect is compared of (a) increasing the size of the electrodes by four by resizing, adapting, and manufacturing the cell prototype using 3-D printing technology and (b) that of stacking four cells to reach the same surface area, using different hydraulic connection configurations. Results demonstrate that the resizing of the electrochemical cell is more successful than stacking four cells. Resizing allows to obtain not only results that are comparable to those obtained by the lower scale cell but even to improve those results, because of the lower impact of edge effects. Regarding hydraulic connection, it was found that it is better to use parallel than series configuration. A simple phenomenological model is used to conclude that scavenging effects are higher when the series configuration is used. The resized cell was fully evaluated from the fluid dynamic behavior, pointing out its outstanding behavior. \\u00a9 2024 The Author(s)\",\n",

In the first, the soil washing is integrated with the bubbling of the oxidant, while in the second, the gas was introduced by a perforated pipe located sub-superficially. Regarding the soil washing treatment, results demonstrate that direct use of ozone is not very efficient, although an important improvement is obtained following activation with hydrogen peroxide or UV light. In contrast, chlorine dioxide exhibited complete methomyl depletion from the soil, although with higher energy consumption and technical complexity compared to ozone. The direct dosing of the gaseous oxidants in perforated pipes is effective, achieving methomyl removals of 7.8 % and 9.2 % using ozone and chlorine dioxide, respectively. In these cases, soil conditions are not significantly modified, which becomes an important advantage of the technology as compared with other electrochemically assisted soil remediation process, in which large regions of the treated soil are affected by important changes in the pH or by depletion of ions. This lower impact makes these novel technologies more promising for further evaluations. \\u00a9 2024 The Author(s)\",\n",

We mainly investigate whether the time of quiescence (delay) in the females phase can induce Hopf bifurcation. By means of analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum, we show that the persistent positive equilibrium is asymptotically stable in the absence of time delay, but loses its stability via Hopf bifurcation when time delay crosses some critical value. Using normal form and center manifold theory, we investigate the stability of the bifurcating branches of periodic solutions and the direction of the Hopf bifurcation.

By means of analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum, we show that the persistent positive equilibrium is asymptotically stable in the absence of time delay, but loses its stability via Hopf bifurcation when time delay crosses some critical value. Using normal form and center manifold theory, we investigate the stability of the bifurcating branches of periodic solutions and the direction of the Hopf bifurcation.

Note that recent experiments upon real platforms show that the cost of migrations has an influence on global system performance. Instead of randomly assigning tasks, we have proposed a task assignment algorithm that has reduced significantly the number of migrations of the DP-WRAP.

This paper introduces ECRDP, an Efficient Clustering Routing approach using a new clustering algorithm based on Density Peaks Clustering (DPC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). First, the PSO algorithm is applied to determine the cluster heads, or a new fitness function for finding the best solutions is formulated using the DPC algorithm. Next, clustering is performed based on the reliability of links parameter between vehicles. Then, a maintenance phase is proposed to update the cluster heads and redistribute the vehicles in the clusters. Finally, the effectiveness of the suggested scheme is evaluated by a simulation operated by MATLAB on a real urban scenario. The results achieved show an overall increase in stability, proven by a reduction in change rate by 74%, and an improvement in performance indicated by an increase in intra-cluster throughput by 34% and inter-cluster by 47%, as well as an overall reduction of average delay by 16%.', 'Type de document': 'Article'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'Implementation of a lithium-ion battery state of charge estimation algorithm for BMS on the real time target NI myRio', 'Auteurs': 'Boukhal, MA ; Lagrat, I ; Elbannay, O', 'Date de publication': '2019', 'Titre de la source': '2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES, EMBEDDED AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (WITS)', 'Mots-clés': ' BMS ; SOC ; Battery ; Coulomb-Counter ; LabView ; implementation ; real time ; control', 'Nombre de citations': '5', 'DOI': '10.1109/wits.2019.8723849', 'Résumé': 'One of the most critical for the purposes of a Battery Management Systems (BMS) is estimating the State of Charge (SoC) of the battery cells.

They are based on modifying the principle of the LBP method where a local neighbourhood is coded in binary by integrating a criterion of its homogeneity. In this work, we define this criterion as the ratio of the total variation in the whole image to the local variation of the neighbourhood. Thus, a new approach of edge detection is presented in two versions according to the way of calculating the differences in a neighbourhood.

While these efforts provided valuable insights, they may not fully capture the complexity of Moroccan web content, which features a blend of Arabic and Latin script. As a result, our study emphasizes the importance of extending sentiment analysis to encompass the entire spectrum of Moroccan linguistic diversity. Central to our research is the creation of the largest public dataset for Moroccan dialect sentiment analysis that incorporates not only Moroccan dialect written in Arabic script but also in Latin characters.

The stringent limitations of the battery of sensor devices and dubious wireless medium incur enormous challenges in the secure data collection and routing. Integration of compressive sensing and cryptography mechanism provide an efficient paradigm for reliable and energy efficient data collection over WSNs. With the aim of reducing communication cost and resilience against different WSN security attacks, this paper proposes a paillier cryptosystem and compressive sensing based routing ((PCSR)-S-2) protocol. To achieve its objective, the proposed (PCSR)-S-2 designs three mechanisms that are paillier cryptosystem based key distribution and management, intra-cluster data gathering, and secure data transmission. Initially, the (PCSR)-S-2 provides paillier security keys to each device for data authentication. Instead of providing a long term security keys among two entities, the lightweight key refreshing mechanism of paillier cryptosystem in (PCSR)-S-2 updates the keys over a specific time interval. Secondly, the design of the Spatio-temporal measurement matrix within the intra-cluster reduces the computation and communication costs considerably. The integration of zero noise factors with all transmitted data assists the BS in detecting and isolating malicious behaviors in the network. Thus, the (PCSR)-S-2 efficiently offers high security in terms of integrity and confidentiality over WSN. We compare (PCSR)-S-2 to existing schemes, CSDA developed in 2017 and CSHEAD in early 2021 which outperform CSDA.

Since the restoration step of super-resolution algorithms is always an ill-posed problem, the choice of the fidelity term and the regularization are always crucial. In this paper, we propose a new variational SR framework based on an automatic selection of the weighting parameter that control the balance between the L-1 and L-2 fidelity terms, which handle different type of noise distributions. Concerning the regularization, we use the combined total variation (TV) and the total variation of the first derivatives (TV2) model with a new implementation of the Primal-dual algorithm to solve the corresponding discretized problem.

The SR techniques strongly depend on the availability of accurate motion estimation. When the estimation of motion is not well established, as usually happens for non-parametric motion, annoying artifacts appear in the super-resolved image. Since SR problems suffer from the motion and blur estimations, new techniques are considered to improve the registration and restoration steps. The proposed method consists of a non-parametric image registration based on diffusion regularization and a nonlocal Laplace regularizer combined with a bilateral filter (BTV) in the reconstruction step to remove noise and motion outliers. The diffusion registration is employed to handle the small deformation between the unregistered images, while the combination of nonlocal Laplace and BTV is used to increase the robustness of the restoration step with respect to the blurring effect and to the noise. We also prove the existence of a solution to the well posed registration problem.

Being able to interpret these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart problems. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction has an important impact in medical diagnostics during the mother pregnancy period. Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in denoising the observed ECG signals using a bilateral total variation (BTV) filter; then minimizing the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the FECG signal from the MECG one.\nResults: We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our proposed method. We will consider many examples of independent/dependent source component signals. The results will be compared with those of the classical method called independent component analysis (ICA) under the same conditions. The accuracy of source estimation is evaluated through a criterion, called again the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The first experiment shows that our proposed method gives accurate estimation of sources in the standard case of independent components, with performance around 27 dB in term of SNR. In the second experiment, we show the capability of the proposed algorithm to successfully separate two noisy mixtures of dependent source components - with classical criterion devoted to the independent case - fails, and that our method is able to deal with the dependent case with good performance.\nConclusions: In this work, we focus specifically on the separation of the ECG signal sources taken from skin two electrodes located on a pregnant woman's body. The ECG separation is interpreted as a noisy linear BSS problem with instantaneous mixtures. Firstly, a denoising step is required to reduce the noise due to motion artifacts using a BTV filter as a very effective one-pass filter for denoising. Then, we use the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the fetal heart rate from the mother one, for both independent and dependent cases."", 'Type de document': 'Article'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'Blind source separation using measure on copulas', 'Auteurs': 'Ghazdali, A ; Hakim, A', 'Date de publication': 'JUN 2015', 'Titre de la source': 'ANNALS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CRAIOVA-MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE SERIESarrow_drop_down', 'Mots-clés': ' Blind source separation ; instantaneous mixtures ; Copulas ; Kullbak-Leibler divergence', 'Nombre de citations': 0, 'DOI': None, 'Résumé': 'The paper introduces a novel BSS algorithm for instantaneous mixtures of both independent and dependent sources.

This study's main purpose is to assess which ML techniques are highly appropriate and accurate regarding such diagnoses. Six supervised ML techniques namely: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) were applied on dataset collected from Kaggle and compared for their accuracy (ACC) and performance in predicting depression. The performance of each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated in terms of ACC, F1-score, Precision (PR), and Sensitivity (SEN). Based on the experimental results analysis, we can conclude that SVM and LR performed better than all other methods with an ACC of 83,32%.

However, in the rush to address the problems of big data and vast numbers of active users, NoSQL dropped certain of the core features of databases that make them highly performant and usable such as the global view, that permits users to access data without needing to know how they are logically organized or physically stored in their sources. We address, in this article, the challenge of how to fill the gap between NoSQL and the Semantic web, in order to enable access to such databases and integration of non-relational data sources. However, we extend the well-known framework for ontology-based data access (OBDA), intending to allow a mediating ontology to query arbitrary databases.

The term vertical bar Delta u vertical bar(2) designates the standard surface diffusion in contrast to the second order term which phenomenologically describes the growth instability. The energy above is mainly carried out in regions of higher surface slope (vertical bar del u vertical bar). Hence minimizing such energy corresponds to reducing surface defects during the growth process from a given initial surface configuration. Our analysis is concerned with the energetic and coarsening behaviours of the equilibrium solution. The existence of global energy minimizers and a scaling argument are used to construct a sequence of equilibrium solutions with different wavelength. We apply our minimum energy estimates to derive bounds in terms of the linear system size vertical bar Omega vertical bar for the characteristic interface width and average slope. We also derive a stable numerical scheme based on the convex-concave decomposition of the energy functional and study its properties while accommodating these results with 1d and 2d numerical simulations.', 'Type de document': 'Article;'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'Mapping vesicle dynamics onto that of a rigid sphere in five dimensions', 'Auteurs': 'Aarab, A ; Guedda, M ; Alaa, N ; Misbah, C', 'Date de publication': 'OCT 11 2018', 'Titre de la source': 'PHYSICAL REVIEW Earrow_drop_down', 'Mots-clés': ' RED-BLOOD-CELLS ; FLUID VESICLES ; VISCOSITY ; PARTICLE ; RHEOLOGY ; MOTION ; LIFT', 'Nombre de citations': '3', 'DOI': '10.1103/PhysRevE.98.042407', 'Résumé': 'Vesicles are sacs made of a phospholipid bilayer, and they mimic the cytoplasmic membrane of real cells, for which red blood cells constitute a canonical example. Vesicles deform under flow, such as a shear flow. Under a linear shear flow, they are known to exhibit several motions that combine orientation and shape deformation (such as tank treading, vacillating breathing, and so on). It is shown here that the equations of motion of a vesicle under shear flow in the weak deformation regime can be mapped onto those of a loaded (or heavy bottom) rigid sphere in five dimensions in fictitious gravitational and shear fields. Based on our previous exact analytical solutions for vesicles (which we extend here to out-of-shear-plane motions), we provide hitherto unrevealed exact explicit solution for the rigid sphere problem. We explain how deformation of a vesicle in real space can be extracted from a rigid body dynamics in five dimensions upon appropriate projection onto a lower dimension.

To overcome this problem we first proposed in [1] a new approach using Block-based BEMD method (BBEMD) where an input image is subdivided into four subblocks, and then the BEMD is applied on each of the four blocks separately. This method offered a good solution to the calculation time, unfortunately blocking artefact is noticeable in the resulting modes, this is a result of ignoring the interblock correlation during the BEMD process and every block was taken as an independent entity when interpolating the blocks borders in the sifting process. The Lapped Block-based BEMD (LBBEMD) is then proposed to whelm the artefact problem using for every block the neighbouring information by enlarging the block neighbourhood related to the two adjacent blocks inside the image during the blocks decomposition. Enlarging neighbourhood blocks necessitate intensive simulations to have for each block the corresponding enlargement size, thing that affects remarkably on the calculation time. Experimentation shows that the LBBEMD can not handle correctly the artefact problems, because the enlargement size can not be enough ""or too big"" to surround all the concerned pixels for each block in the image. The problem with the LBBEMD is to exactly define, a priori, for each block the size of the neighbouring enlargement size. In this paper, we will present an adaptive and fast Block Empirical mode decomposition to eliminate definitively the artefacts problems when subdividing an image into lapped blocks and we will prove, by simulations, that our method offers a good trade-off between computational time and decomposition quality.', 'Type de document': 'Article'}]","[{'issn': '2469-9950', 'scope': 'Physical Review B (PRB) is the world’s largest dedicated physics journal, publishing approximately 100 new, high-quality papers each week.

Many mathematical models have been conducted to understand, control, and predict its spread. In this paper we propose a mathematical model with memory effect modelling HIV transmission in a heterosexual population divided into two age classes; young-class (15-24 years old) and grown-class (25 years old and over). The goal of dividing the population according to age is to identify the most vulnerable class to the virus based on their sexual activity and make accurate predictions about HIV transmission. First, we determine the biologically significant space for the study, and we prove the existence of a unique solution. Then we divide the principal model into four sub-models: young-people, grown-people, young-men linked to grown-women, grown-men linked to young-women. The basic reproduction number associated to each sub-model is derived. According to the four sub-models, we have found that, if the basic reproduction number is below unity, then the free disease equilibrium state is locally asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results and discuss the local stability of the endemic equilibrium states of each sub-model. We conclude that incorporating memory conservation gives more realistic results, where reaching a stable state takes higher time.

The evolution equations of the swimmer orientation and its position are nonlinear and analytical results are the exception rather than the rule.

The solution for the swimmer orientation is inspired from a method due to Bretherton, initially developed for a different nonlinear equation. We show here that this method can be generalized to our evolution equation.

It implies an analysis be conducted in order to identify and manage the areas at risk of overexposure where an increasing risk to human health is suspected. The development of methods is a prerequisite for implementing public health activities aimed at protecting populations. Methods This paper presents the methodological framework developed by INERIS (French National Institute for Industrial Environment and Risks) to identify a common framework for a structured and operationalized assessment of human exposure. An integrated exposure assessment approach has been developed to integrate the multiplicity of exposure pathways from various sources, through a series of models enabling the final exposure of a population to be defined. Results Measured data from environmental networks reflecting the actual contamination of the environment are used to gauge the population's exposure. Sophisticated methods of spatial analysis are applied to include additional information and take benefit of spatial and inter-variable correlation to improve data representativeness and characterize the associated uncertainty. Integrated approaches bring together all the information available for assessing the source-to-human-dose continuum using a Geographic Information System, multimedia exposure and toxicokinetic model. Discussion One of the objectives of the integrated approach was to demonstrate the feasibility of building complex realistic exposure scenarios satisfying the needs of stakeholders and the accuracy of the modelling predictions at a fine spatial-temporal resolution. A case study is presented to provide a specific application of the proposed framework and how the results could be used to identify an overexposed population.

Most previous studies have assessed individual exposure to Rf-Emf, and the next level is to assess populational exposure. In our study, we designed a statistical tool for Rf-Emf populational exposure assessment and mapping. This tool integrates geographic databases and surrogate models to characterize spatiotemporal exposure from outdoor sources, indoor sources, and mobile phones. A case study was conducted on a 100 x 100 m grid covering the 14th district of Paris to illustrate the functionalities of the tool. Whole-body specific absorption rate (SAR) values are 2.7 times higher than those for the whole brain. The mapping of whole-body and whole-brain SAR values shows a dichotomy between built-up and non-built-up areas, with the former displaying higher values. Maximum SAR values do not exceed 3.5 and 3.9 mW/kg for the whole body and the whole brain, respectively, thus they are significantly below International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) recommendations.

It is shown here that the equations of motion of a vesicle under shear flow in the weak deformation regime can be mapped onto those of a loaded (or heavy bottom) rigid sphere in five dimensions in fictitious gravitational and shear fields. Based on our previous exact analytical solutions for vesicles (which we extend here to out-of-shear-plane motions), we provide hitherto unrevealed exact explicit solution for the rigid sphere problem.

Twin SVM generally consists in determining two non-parallel planes by alternately solving two constrained optimization models. Solving this problem using the classical Lagrangian method has many limitations, notably: its only limited to handle Gaussian noise, generally exaggerates the influence of outliers and cannot handle unbalanced data, this due to the differentiability of the model. To circumvent these issues, we transform two-constraint optimization models using the penalty method into an unconstrained non-smooth optimization one.

Recently, many works have focused on defining a relationship between supervised learning and the well-known inverse problems. However, this connection between the learning problem and the inverse one has been done in the particular case where the inverse problem is reformulated as a minimization problem with a quadratic cost functional (L2 cost functional). Although, it is well known that the cost functional can be L1 or any positive function that measures the gap between the predicted data and the observed one. Indeed, the use of L1 loss function for supervised learning problem gives more consistent results (see Rosasco et al. in Neural Comput 16:1063-1076, 2004). This strengthens the idea of reformulating the inverse problem, associated to machine learning problem, into a minimization problem using L1 functional. However, the L1 loss function is non-differentiable, which precludes the use of standard optimization tools.

As a result, the proposed SR approach can efficiently preserve image features such as corner and texture much better with less blur near edges. The existence and uniqueness of the proposed partial differential equation (PDE) are also demonstrated in an appropriate functional space. Finally, the given experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed PDE compared to some competitive methods in both visually and quantitatively.', 'Type de document': 'Article'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'A new multiframe super-resolution based on nonlinear registration and a spatially weighted regularization', 'Auteurs': 'Laghrib, A ; Hadri, A ; Hakim, A ; Raghay, S', 'Date de publication': 'AUG 2019', 'Titre de la source': 'INFORMATION SCIENCESarrow_drop_down', 'Mots-clés': ' ADAPTIVE REGULARIZATION ; IMAGE SUPERRESOLUTION ; RECONSTRUCTION ; RESOLUTION ; MOTION Super-resolution ; Spatially weighted ; Hyperelastic registration ; Variational regularization', 'Nombre de citations': '23', 'DOI': '10.1016/j.ins.2019.04.029', 'Résumé': 'Increasing the size of an image is an extensively studied problem in image processing. In recent years, many studies have been conducted on image super-resolution (SR). Since the super-resolution techniques depend on the motion precision estimation, we investigate the use of a nonlinear elastic (called hyperelastic) image registration. Also, we propose a spatially weighted second order SR algorithm, which takes into account the distribution of the spatial information in different image areas. The hyperelastic image registration is used to handle the subpixel errors between the unregistered images, while the spatially weighted second order regularization allows to increase the robustness of the restoration step with respect to degradation factors (blur and noise). As a result, the registration model is more efficient and easier to implement and the proposed SR algorithm reduces artifacts in flat regions of the image and also preserves well sharp edges. The efficiency of the proposed model is demonstrated using simulated and real tests, while comparison with other competitive SR methods is achieved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Since the SR methods are always considered as ill-posed problems, great interest is therefore investigated to reconstruct an image with less artefacts. In this paper, we propose a high-order partial differential equation (PDE) that preserve singularities and edge continuities while smoothing. This PDE is based on anisotropic diffusion behavior by adding some constraints to the Weickert coherence enhancing diffusion tensor in order to control the diffusion process near edges and avoids tiny corners destruction. In fact, this PDE combine between the diffusion process of Perona-Malik in the flat regions and the anisotropic diffusion of the Weickert model near strong edges. Moreover, the introduction of the high-order derivatives reduces unwanted artifacts such as staircasing.

Since the SR problem is considered as an ill-posed one, the regularization techniques are then inevitable. However, the choice of the fidelity and regularization terms is not easy and plays a major role in the quality of the desired HR image. In this paper, we propose a new nonconvex data fitting term and a fractional total variation regularization term for image super-resolution. The proposed model differs from existing image variational SR models where the fidelity term is always derived from the L-1 or L-2- norm, and the regularization term is based on a widely choice of convex and nonconvex functions. The use of the nonconvex data fitting term can efficiently reduce complex noises such as impulse noise while the fractional order regularization term preserves image features like edges and texture much better.

Furthermore, cardiac arrhythmias are intimately related to the signaling ability of cardiac cells, and are caused by signaling defects. Consequently, modeling the electrical activity of the heart, and the complex signaling models that subtend dangerous arrhythmias such as tachycardia and fibrillation, necessitates a quantitative model of action potential (AP) propagation. Yet, many electrophysiological models, which accurately reproduce dynamical characteristic of the action potential in cells, have been introduced. However, these models are very complex and are very time consuming computationally. Consequently, a large amount of research is consecrated to design models with less computational complexity.\nResults: This paper is presenting a new model for analyzing the propagation of ionic concentrations and electrical potential in space and time. In this model, the transport of ions is governed by Nernst-Planck flux equation (NP), and the electrical interaction of the species is described by a new cable equation. These set of equations form a system of coupled partial nonlinear differential equations that is solved numerically. In the first we describe the mathematical model.

Grouped under the same ""dead-water"" vocabulary, two wave-making resistance phenomena have been historically reported. The first, the Nansen wave-making drag, generates a stationary internal wake which produces a kinematic drag with a noticeable hysteresis. The second, the Ekman wave-making drag, is characterized by velocity oscillations caused by a dynamical resistance whose origin is still unclear. The latter has been justified previously by a periodic emission of nonlinear internal waves. Here we show that these speed variations are due to the generation of an internal dispersive undulating depression produced during the initial acceleration of the ship within a linear regime. The dispersive undulating depression front and its subsequent whelps act as a bumpy treadmill on which the ship would move back and forth. We provide an analytical description of the coupled dynamics of the ship and the wave, which demonstrates the unsteady motion of the ship. Thanks to dynamic calculations substantiated by laboratory experiments, we prove that this oscillating regime is only temporary: the ship will escape the transient Ekman regime while maintaining its propulsion force, reaching the asymptotic Nansen limit.

The main idea is to decompose the image into two components: cartoon and texture parts using a new spatially controlled diffusion obtained by incorporating into R.D. equation an anti-diffusion effect modelled by a space dependent parameter gamma. Hence, the proposed equation leads to a noticeable improvement in texture structure preservation. Moreover, we demonstrate an existence result of global solutions and analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the equation. Furthermore, an approximation of the sensitive parameter gamma is established using a learning optimization technique. As a result, the anti-diffusion parameter gamma can be efficiently computed to increase the quality of the restored image and preserve its texture. The proposed approach is tested and validated using multiple numerical experiments alongside a comparison with some competitive methods for a variety of applications including image de-noising, decomposition and super-resolution.

The diffusion registration is employed to handle the small deformation between the unregistered images, while the combination of nonlocal Laplace and BTV is used to increase the robustness of the restoration step with respect to the blurring effect and to the noise.

Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in denoising the observed ECG signals using a bilateral total variation (BTV) filter; then minimizing the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the FECG signal from the MECG one.\nResults: We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our proposed method. We will consider many examples of independent/dependent source component signals. The results will be compared with those of the classical method called independent component analysis (ICA) under the same conditions. The accuracy of source estimation is evaluated through a criterion, called again the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The first experiment shows that our proposed method gives accurate estimation of sources in the standard case of independent components, with performance around 27 dB in term of SNR. In the second experiment, we show the capability of the proposed algorithm to successfully separate two noisy mixtures of dependent source components - with classical criterion devoted to the independent case - fails, and that our method is able to deal with the dependent case with good performance.\nConclusions: In this work, we focus specifically on the separation of the ECG signal sources taken from skin two electrodes located on a pregnant woman's body. The ECG separation is interpreted as a noisy linear BSS problem with instantaneous mixtures. Firstly, a denoising step is required to reduce the noise due to motion artifacts using a BTV filter as a very effective one-pass filter for denoising. Then, we use the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the fetal heart rate from the mother one, for both independent and dependent cases."", 'Type de document': 'Article'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'A combined total variation and bilateral filter approach for image robust super resolution', 'Auteurs': 'Laghrib, A ; Hakim, A ; Raghay, S', 'Date de publication': 'JUN 26 2015', 'Titre de la source': 'EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSINGarrow_drop_down', 'Mots-clés': ' RECONSTRUCTION Super resolution ; Bilateral filter ; Bounded variation space ; Total variation ; Function relaxed', 'Nombre de citations': '34', 'DOI': '10.1186/s13640-015-0075-4', 'Résumé': 'In this paper, we consider the image super-resolution (SR) reconstitution problem. The main goal consists of obtaining a high-resolution (HR) image from a set of low-resolution (LR) ones. For that, we propose a novel approach based on a regularized criterion. The criterion is composed of the classical generalized total variation (TV) but adding a bilateral filter (BTV) regularizer. The main goal of our approach consists of the derivation and the use of an efficient combined deblurring and denoising stage that is applied on the high-resolution image. We demonstrate the existence of minimizers of the combined variational problem in the bounded variation space, and we propose a minimization algorithm. The numerical results obtained by our approach are compared with the classical robust super-resolution (RSR) algorithm and the SR with TV regularization.

The term vertical bar Delta u vertical bar(2) designates the standard surface diffusion in contrast to the second order term which phenomenologically describes the growth instability. The energy above is mainly carried out in regions of higher surface slope (vertical bar del u vertical bar). Hence minimizing such energy corresponds to reducing surface defects during the growth process from a given initial surface configuration.

The existence of global energy minimizers and a scaling argument are used to construct a sequence of equilibrium solutions with different wavelength.

It is shown here that the equations of motion of a vesicle under shear flow in the weak deformation regime can be mapped onto those of a loaded (or heavy bottom) rigid sphere in five dimensions in fictitious gravitational and shear fields. Based on our previous exact analytical solutions for vesicles (which we extend here to out-of-shear-plane motions), we provide hitherto unrevealed exact explicit solution for the rigid sphere problem.

Furthermore, cardiac arrhythmias are intimately related to the signaling ability of cardiac cells, and are caused by signaling defects. Consequently, modeling the electrical activity of the heart, and the complex signaling models that subtend dangerous arrhythmias such as tachycardia and fibrillation, necessitates a quantitative model of action potential (AP) propagation. Yet, many electrophysiological models, which accurately reproduce dynamical characteristic of the action potential in cells, have been introduced. However, these models are very complex and are very time consuming computationally. Consequently, a large amount of research is consecrated to design models with less computational complexity.\nResults: This paper is presenting a new model for analyzing the propagation of ionic concentrations and electrical potential in space and time. In this model, the transport of ions is governed by Nernst-Planck flux equation (NP), and the electrical interaction of the species is described by a new cable equation. These set of equations form a system of coupled partial nonlinear differential equations that is solved numerically. In the first we describe the mathematical model. To realize the numerical simulation of our model, we proceed by a finite element discretization and then we choose an appropriate resolution algorithm.\nConclusions: We give numerical simulations obtained for different input scenarios in the case of suicide substrate reaction which were compared to those obtained in literature. These input scenarios have been chosen so as to provide an intuitive understanding of dynamics of the model. By accessing time and space domains, it is shown that interpreting the electrical potential of cell membrane at steady state is incorrect. This model is general and applies to ions of any charge in space and time domains. The results obtained show a complete agreement with literature findings and also with the physical interpretation of the phenomenon. Furthermore, various numerical experiments are presented to confirm the accuracy, efficiency and stability of the proposed method. In particular, we show that the scheme is second-order accurate in space.', 'Type de document': 'Article'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'IMAGE RESTORATION USING A REACTION-DIFFUSION PROCESS', 'Auteurs': 'Alaa, N ; Aitoussous, M ; Bouarifi, W ; Bensikaddour, D', 'Date de publication': 'SEP 22 2014', 'Titre de la source': 'ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONSarrow_drop_down', 'Mots-clés': ' WEAK SOLUTIONS ; GLOBAL EXISTENCE ; EDGE-DETECTION ; EQUATIONS ; MASS ; SYSTEMS ; SPACE ; HEAT Degenerate elliptic systems ; quasilinear ; chemotaxis ; angiogenesis ; weak solutions', 'Nombre de citations': '3', 'DOI': None, 'Résumé': 'This study shows how partial differential equations can be employed to restore a digital image.

The emergence of temporal database calls for new visual and efficient modeling techniques to facilitate the design of temporal objects. Even though UML is not currently equipped to manage this task, UML and extended extension offered limited means to express time-varying data and temporal constraints over the dynamic behavior of temporal objects. Therefore, the object constraint language (OCL) plays an important role in the elaboration of the correct conceptual schema that allows the definition of the restrictions and the constraints which contain the duplicate and complex expression. In this paper, we present a UML extension enriched by OCL features and Bitemporal dimension to improve the understandability of a UML/OCL model, and its ability to support the temporal attributes and their evolution. The proposed temporal UML/OCL based on Bitemporal data will be translating into their corresponding in a temporal object-Relational database for the purpose of tracking historical information with an efficient manner. An algorithm has been proposed to automate the transformation from the conceptual schema enriched by bitemporal features to temporal object relational database model by following different steps such as classifying and extracting information about classes, relationships and attributes.

We propose a multimodal framework for adapting multimedia documents based on a distributed implementation of W3C's Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces applied to ubiquitous computing. The core of our proposed architecture is the presence of a smart interaction manager that accepts context related information from sensors in the environment as well as from other sources, including information available on the web and multimodal user inputs. The interaction manager integrates and reasons over this information to predict the user's situation and service use. A key to realizing this framework is the use of an ontology that undergirds the communication and representation, and the use of the cloud to insure the service continuity on heterogeneous mobile devices.

The reason why we have conducted this study is the absence of diversity slum mapping in the form of dynamic GIS data, which can be a part of national development strategies to tackle the risk of further proliferation of shantytowns. Therefore, we first create a new database integration from five countries whose content contains 1366 high -resolution patches of 224 x 224 pixels divided into five classes: two types of ""Urban Slum"", one type of ""Rural Slum"", ""Formal Buildings"", and non -built-up area. Second, we suggest employing a variety of performance metrics to come up with the best transfer learning -based models for the unfreezing stage. The study reveals that by handling the unfreezing of the front layers, we can produce a reliable new model where one condition is fulfilled, namely, where high -frequency dissimilarities have arisen between the target and the source datasets. Quantitative results of these methodologies show that our dataset and our unfreezing strategy for the mobilenetv2 model are more accurate compared to other competing models. This new model can localize all possible changes in morphology and shape among the threeslum types with state-of-the-art performance that reaches an overall accuracy of 98.17%, a loss of 0.062, and a kappa score of 97.71%.

Despite feeding the model with an adequate amount of labeled data to mitigate fluctuations during training, the model still suffers from high variance in the final overall accuracy and loss among identical training runs. Many of the reasons behind this are the randomness in data shuffling and augmentation, the behavior of gradient decent function, and the non-determinism in convnet layers and floating-point computation of the GPU.The method used to address the aforementioned issues, specifically in the case of negative transfer learning, is divided into three steps: First, designing an efficient lightweight con-vnet architecture with respect to available resources. Second, mitigating oscillations dur-ing training. Third, after setting the random seed across the training, select the appropri-ate weight initialization. Our extensive experiments in the use case of binary slum local-ization and detection show that our method improves the reproducibility of our model from scratch with an accuracy of 98.88 +/- 1.15%, a loss of 0.03 +/- 0.05 for a confidence level of 99.73%.

It can cause serious problems such as suicide. Therefore, early detection is important to stop the progression of this disease that could endanger human lives. Predicting and detecting early-stage depression using machine learning (ML) techniques is a promising strategy. This study's main purpose is to assess which ML techniques are highly appropriate and accurate regarding such diagnoses. Six supervised ML techniques namely: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) were applied on dataset collected from Kaggle and compared for their accuracy (ACC) and performance in predicting depression.

The most significant barrier preventing many businesses from moving to the cloud is the security of crucial data maintained by the cloud provider. The cloud server must have complete access to the data to respond to a client request. That implies the decryption key must be sent to the cloud by the client, which may compromise the confidentiality of data stored in the cloud. One way to allow the cloud to use encrypted data without knowing or decrypting it is homomorphic encryption.

However, the complexity of the underlying mechanisms of AI systems can render it difficult for humans to understand and trust AI-driven decisions.

Based on a systematic literature survey, We explore the latest techniques and approaches that are helping manufacturers gain transparency in the decision-making processes of their AI systems. In this survey, we focus on two of the most exciting areas of XAI: ontology-based and semantic-based XAI (O-XAI, S-XAI, respectively), which provide human-readable explanations of AI decisions by exploiting semantic information. These latter types of explanations are presented in natural language and are designed to be easily understood by non-experts. Translating the decision paths taken by AI algorithms to meaningful explanations through semantics, O-XAI, and S-XAI enables humans to identify various cross-cutting concerns that influence the decisions made by the AI system. This information can be used to improve the performance of the AI system, identify potential biases in the system, and ensure that the decisions are aligned with the goals and values of the manufacturing organization.

One of the reasons is the lack of resources and available texts for these languages. Urdu is one, with millions of native and non-native speakers across the globe. In this paper, the Urdu language domain is focused on to identify opinion targets from written Urdu texts. To accomplish this task, several syntactic rules are crafted to identify users' opinions and associated target words. These rules are crafted using the grammatical and linguistic context of the words in the sentence. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work available in the Urdu domain for opinion target extraction.

In order to evaluate the economic viability, key performance indicators, such as net present value (NPV), levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), and operating costs etc. are studied. The major textile industry located in the Raiwind area of Punjab province of Pakistan has been selected. The effect and variations of the capacity factor has also been studied coupled with the levelized cost of electricity. The agricultural residue as feedstock to the gasifier is rice husk that is the abundantly available in South Asia. Furthermore, the impact of government subsidies on natural gas is also under the scope of the study. The agro-industrial residue gasification system is found to be a potential alternative to furnace oil (FO) or gas-based captive power plants (CPPs). The results of residue-based gasification system imply a large potential when comparing the cost of electricity with national grid electricity during the peak hours. Therefore, the proposed gasification system offers economic incentives when the textile industry potentially utilizes gasification-based electricity during peak hours and national grid electricity during off-peak hours.

The adaptivity in the user interfaces requires in depth knowledge of context. There is a need to enrich user profiles to achieve the personalized services with the ability to adapt the user's context. The context can be reflected in a particular kind of knowledge and hence modeled as ontology. Ontology based context models are effective means to handle complex situations that support the sharing or integration of context information. This paper presents ontology based context model using OWL for adaptive mobile devices. It models the context over its four major elements including device, user, environment (location and time) and activity. The proposed ontology was derived in different classes, relationships, associations, dependencies and constraints to model dynamic context. Ontologies present a standardized, consistent and shareable context model. The context model and consequent context snapshots can be acknowledged by AUI to present a suitable user interface. The ontology was developed using Protege on the basis of each context type having different values. Semantic querying (SPARQL) was used for knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the Pellet and HermiT Reasoner were used to verify the rules, relations and constraints to avoid the inconsistency between classes.

The reason why we have conducted this study is the absence of diversity slum mapping in the form of dynamic GIS data, which can be a part of national development strategies to tackle the risk of further proliferation of shantytowns. Therefore, we first create a new database integration from five countries whose content contains 1366 high -resolution patches of 224 x 224 pixels divided into five classes: two types of ""Urban Slum"", one type of ""Rural Slum"", ""Formal Buildings"", and non -built-up area. Second, we suggest employing a variety of performance metrics to come up with the best transfer learning -based models for the unfreezing stage. The study reveals that by handling the unfreezing of the front layers, we can produce a reliable new model where one condition is fulfilled, namely, where high -frequency dissimilarities have arisen between the target and the source datasets. Quantitative results of these methodologies show that our dataset and our unfreezing strategy for the mobilenetv2 model are more accurate compared to other competing models. This new model can localize all possible changes in morphology and shape among the threeslum types with state-of-the-art performance that reaches an overall accuracy of 98.17%, a loss of 0.062, and a kappa score of 97.71%.

Despite feeding the model with an adequate amount of labeled data to mitigate fluctuations during training, the model still suffers from high variance in the final overall accuracy and loss among identical training runs. Many of the reasons behind this are the randomness in data shuffling and augmentation, the behavior of gradient decent function, and the non-determinism in convnet layers and floating-point computation of the GPU.The method used to address the aforementioned issues, specifically in the case of negative transfer learning, is divided into three steps: First, designing an efficient lightweight con-vnet architecture with respect to available resources. Second, mitigating oscillations dur-ing training. Third, after setting the random seed across the training, select the appropri-ate weight initialization. Our extensive experiments in the use case of binary slum local-ization and detection show that our method improves the reproducibility of our model from scratch with an accuracy of 98.88 +/- 1.15%, a loss of 0.03 +/- 0.05 for a confidence level of 99.73%.

In this work, the comparison of the ammonium (NH4+) of the 24 h balance with the daily average values of DO and ORP for each basin showed that when the oxygen concentration is low, the NH4+ concentration is high. The maximum NH4+ value of around 10.3 mg N/L is obtained on the day when the DO concentration is almost zero at the level of one of the 4 basins, which is basin B1. Moreover, knowing that the influent flow is unstable, the punctual monitoring of these parameters at the exit of each basin showed that during the mornings the punctual concentrations of NH4+ are generally low in comparison to NO3- concentrations which are high and the measurements of DO and ORP which correspond are important. Conversely, the results obtained during afternoons with high values of NH4+ correspond to low values of DO, ORP and NO3-. This shows that the need for oxygen also fluctuates during the day. In real-time control, the use of key parameters obtained from temporary readings of the DO and ORP profiles provide valuable information on the biological nitrification-denitrification process: The DO breakpoint indicates the disappearance of NH4+ during the aerobic phase (end of nitrification), called DO elbow are break points on ORP profiles; the ORP knee on the ORP profile signifies the control point where the nitrate has been effectively reduced during the non-aeration cycle (the nitrate knee), The oxygen-uptake rate which can reflect the activity of microorganisms.

This study's main purpose is to assess which ML techniques are highly appropriate and accurate regarding such diagnoses. Six supervised ML techniques namely: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) were applied on dataset collected from Kaggle and compared for their accuracy (ACC) and performance in predicting depression. The performance of each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated in terms of ACC, F1-score, Precision (PR), and Sensitivity (SEN). Based on the experimental results analysis, we can conclude that SVM and LR performed better than all other methods with an ACC of 83,32%.

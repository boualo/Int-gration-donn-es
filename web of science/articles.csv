In the current paper, we present a delayed mathematical model describing the dynamics of Ae. aegypti. Our model is governed by a system of three delay differential equations modeling the interactions between three compartments of the Ae. aegypti life cycle (females, eggs and pupae). By using time delay as a parameter of bifurcation, we prove stability/switch stability of the possible equilibrium points and the existence of bifurcating branch of small amplitude periodic solutions when time delay crosses some critical value. We establish an algorithm determining the direction of bifurcation and stability of bifurcating periodic solutions. In the end, some numerical simulations are carried out to support theoretical results..",Article;,1937-1632
Oscillations Induced by Quiescent Adult Female in a Reaction-Diffusion Model of Wild Aedes Aegypti Mosquitoes,"Aghriche, A ; Yafia, R ; Alaoui, MAA ; Tridane, A ; Rihan, FA",DEC 15 2019,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOSarrow_drop_down, HOPF-BIFURCATION ANALYSIS ; STABILITY Aedes aegypti dynamics ; reaction-diffusion system ; DDE ; Hopf bifurcation,4,10.1142/S021812741950189X,"This paper takes the reaction-diffusion approach to deal with the quiescent females phase, so as to describe the dynamics of invasion of aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are divided into three subpopulations: eggs, pupae and female. We mainly investigate whether the time of quiescence (delay) in the females phase can induce Hopf bifurcation. By means of analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum, we show that the persistent positive equilibrium is asymptotically stable in the absence of time delay, but loses its stability via Hopf bifurcation when time delay crosses some critical value. Using normal form and center manifold theory, we investigate the stability of the bifurcating branches of periodic solutions and the direction of the Hopf bifurcation. Numerical simulations are carried out to support our theoretical results.",Article,0218-1274

Our aim is to investigate theoretically and numerically the asymptotic behavior of the interior equilibrium of the model. The conditions of boundedness, existence of a positively invariant set are proved. Criteria for local stability/instability and global stability are obtained. By using the bifurcation theory, the conditions of Hopf and Turing bifurcation critical lines in a spatial domain are proved.

REDUCING THE INTERPROCESSORS MIGRATIONS OF THE EKG ALGORITHM,"Daoudi, E ; Dargham, A ; Kerfali, A ; Khatiri, M",SEP 2018,SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCEarrow_drop_down, Real time scheduling ; EKG ; semi-partitioning real time scheduling ; inter processor migrations,1,10.12694/scpe.v19i3.1397,"In this work, we consider the scheduling problem of a set of periodic implicit-deadline and synchronous tasks, on a real-time multiprocessor composed of m identical processors. It is known that the cost of migrations and preemptions has significant influence on global system performances. The EKG algorithm can generate a great number of migrant tasks, but it has the advantage that each migrant task migrates between two processors only. Later, the EDHS algorithm has been proposed in order to minimize the number of migrant tasks of EKG. Although EDHS minimizes the number of migration compared to EKG, its drawback is the generation of additional preemptions caused by the migrations on several processors. In this paper we propose a new tasks allocation algorithm that aims to combine the advantages of EKG (migrations between two processors only) and those of EDHS (reduction of number of migrations).",Article,1895-1767

Reducing the inter processor migrations of the DP-WRAP scheduling,"Daoudi, E ; Dargham, A ; Kerfali, A ; Khatiri, M",2015,2015 IEEE/ACS 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS (AICCSA), Real time scheduling ; global scheduling ; DP-Fair ; DP-WRAP algorithm ; multiprocessor system ; inter processors migrations,0,,"In this work, we consider the scheduling problem of a set of periodic implicit-deadline and synchronous tasks, on a real-time multiprocessor composed of m identical processors. Our contribution consists in improving the temporal distribution ofDPWRAP algorithm by reducing the number of migrations. Indeed, DP-WRAP algorithm assigns tasks randomly and does not take into account the cost of migrations which can reach (m-I) migrations in the worst case. Note that recent experiments upon real platforms show that the cost of migrations has an influence on global system performance. Instead of randomly assigning tasks, we have proposed a task assignment algorithm that has reduced significantly the number of migrations of the DP-WRAP. The first step of the proposed algorithm, based on the classical bin-packing heuristics, allows minimizing the number of migrant tasks, the second step consists in assigning efficiently the migrant tasks. Experimental simulations show that the number of migrations, compared to DP-WRAP, is significantly reduced. This reduction can reach 60%",Proceedings Paper,2161-5322

The technique of support vector machines has been exploited for the data obtained from the multi-sensor system in order to distinguish the potato types mentioned by following two methods: a direct method where all the data have been exploited with a rate of success of 91.7%, and a composed method where the classification was first between naturally treated samples and those treated differently with a success rate of 96.7%, then a classification between those treated differently had a 92.5% success rate. A microbiological analysis was also carried out and its results were compared with those obtained by the E-nose. As per the two methods' results, the distinction of the potato types by the nature of the cultivated fields is possible with the recording of the multisensory system superiority due to response time, low cost, simplicity, and portability.",Article,0957-0233

In urban environments, vehicles move continuously and at different speeds, which leads to frequent changes in the network topology. The main issue faced in an urban scenario is the performance of routing protocols when delivering data from one vehicle to another. This paper introduces ECRDP, an Efficient Clustering Routing approach using a new clustering algorithm based on Density Peaks Clustering (DPC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). First, the PSO algorithm is applied to determine the cluster heads, or a new fitness function for finding the best solutions is formulated using the DPC algorithm. Next, clustering is performed based on the reliability of links parameter between vehicles. Then, a maintenance phase is proposed to update the cluster heads and redistribute the vehicles in the clusters. Finally, the effectiveness of the suggested scheme is evaluated by a simulation operated by MATLAB on a real urban scenario. The results achieved show an overall increase in stability, proven by a reduction in change rate by 74%, and an improvement in performance indicated by an increase in intra-cluster throughput by 34% and inter-cluster by 47%, as well as an overall reduction of average delay by 16%.",Article,2169-3536

A modified Local Binary Pattern based on homogeneity criterion for robust edge detection,"Aboutabit, N",JUL 2023,SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSINGarrow_drop_down, Edge detection ; Local binary pattern ; Homogeneity criteria ; Image processing,1,10.1007/s11760-022-02448-0,"Today, the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) has become one of the most widely used texture descriptors thanks to its invariance and efficiency. The basic LBP method encodes local features by considering the difference in the local neighbourhood to represent a given image using the binary pattern histogram. Without performing the histogram step, the LBP method could be used to detect edges in an image. In this paper, two algorithms for edge detection are proposed. They are based on modifying the principle of the LBP method where a local neighbourhood is coded in binary by integrating a criterion of its homogeneity. In this work, we define this criterion as the ratio of the total variation in the whole image to the local variation of the neighbourhood. Thus, a new approach of edge detection is presented in two versions according to the way of calculating the differences in a neighbourhood. Experimental results on a standard natural image database show that the two proposed algorithms significantly improve the MSE, PSNR and SSIM indicators of the famous Canny detector and the improved LBP approach.

Generally, the FIM problem can be solved by either the exact or metaheuristic-based methods. Exact methods, such as the Apriori algorithm, are highly effective for dealing with small to medium datasets. However, these methods need more temporal complexity when dealing with large datasets. Metaheuristic-based methods are becoming more rapid, but the majority still need to be more precise. Several studies were carried out to address these issues and improve metaheuristics-based approaches by combining the Apriori algorithm with several metaheuristics algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The result of this combination gave birth to two approaches: GA-Apriori and PSO-Apriori. Consequently, after performing several studies on different database instances, the results revealed that the two approaches outperformed the Apriori algorithm in terms of runtime.

However, one aspect that has remained underrepresented is the sentiment analysis of the Moroccan dialect, which boasts a unique linguistic landscape and the coexistence of multiple scripts. Previous works in sentiment analysis primarily targeted dialects employing Arabic script. While these efforts provided valuable insights, they may not fully capture the complexity of Moroccan web content, which features a blend of Arabic and Latin script. As a result, our study emphasizes the importance of extending sentiment analysis to encompass the entire spectrum of Moroccan linguistic diversity. Central to our research is the creation of the largest public dataset for Moroccan dialect sentiment analysis that incorporates not only Moroccan dialect written in Arabic script but also in Latin characters. By assembling a diverse range of textual data, we were able to construct a dataset with a range of 19,991 manually labeled texts in Moroccan dialect and also publicly available lists of stop words in Moroccan dialect as a new contribution to Moroccan Arabic resources. In our exploration of sentiment analysis, we undertook a comprehensive study encompassing various machine-learning models to assess their compatibility with our dataset. While our investigation revealed that the highest accuracy of 98.42% was attained through the utilization of the DarijaBert-mix transfer-learning model, we also delved into deep learning models. Notably, our experimentation yielded a commendable accuracy rate of 92% when employing a CNN model. Furthermore, in an effort to affirm the reliability of our dataset, we tested the CNN model using smaller publicly available datasets of Moroccan dialect, with results that proved to be promising and supportive of our findings.",Article;,1574-020X

Enhancing Entity Resolution with a hybrid Active Machine Learning framework: Strategies for optimal learning in sparse datasets,"Jabrane, M ; Tabbaa, H ; Hadri, A ; Hafidi, I",NOV 2024,INFORMATION SYSTEMSarrow_drop_down, LINKAGE Entity Resolution ; Active Machine Learning ; Informativeness ; Representativeness,0,10.1016/j.is.2024.102410,"When solving the problem of identifying similar records in different datasets (known as Entity Resolution or ER), one big challenge is the lack of enough labeled data. Which is crucial for building strong machine learning models, but getting this data can be expensive and time-consuming. Active Machine Learning (ActiveML) is a helpful approach because it cleverly picks the most useful pieces of data to learn from. It uses two main ideas: informativeness and representativeness. Typical ActiveML methods used in ER usually depend too much on just one of these ideas, which can make them less effective, especially when starting with very little data. Our research introduces a new combined method that uses both ideas together. We created two versions of this method, called DPQ and STQ, and tested them on eleven different real -world datasets. The results showed that our new method improves ER by producing better scores, more stable models, and faster learning with less training data compared to existing methods.",Article,0306-4379

FS is categorized as NP-Hard due to the high number of existing solutions. Various metaheuristic methods have been developed to address the FS problem, yielding promising results. Particularly, particle swarm optimization (PSO), an evolutionary computing (EC) approach guided by swarm intelligence, has gained widespread adoption owing to its implementation simplicity and potential for global search. This paper analyzes several variants of PSO algorithms and introduces a new FS method called HPSO. The proposed approach utilizes an asynchronously adaptive inertia weight and an improved constriction factor. Additionally, it incorporates a chaotic map and a MAD fitness function with a feature count penalty to tackle the clustering FS problem. The efficiency of the developed method is evaluated against the genetic algorithm (GA) and well-known variants of PSO algorithms, including PSOs with fixed inertia weights, PSOs with improved inertia weights, PSOs with fixed constriction factors, PSOs with improved constriction factors, PSOs with adaptive inertia weights, and PSO's includes advanced learning exemplars and sophisticated structure topologies.

Generally, the FIM problem can be solved by either the exact or metaheuristic-based methods. Exact methods, such as the Apriori algorithm, are highly effective for dealing with small to medium datasets. However, these methods need more temporal complexity when dealing with large datasets. Metaheuristic-based methods are becoming more rapid, but the majority still need to be more precise. Several studies were carried out to address these issues and improve metaheuristics-based approaches by combining the Apriori algorithm with several metaheuristics algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The result of this combination gave birth to two approaches: GA-Apriori and PSO-Apriori.

However, WSN has been proven to be vulnerable to security breaches. The harsh and unattended deploy-ment of these networks, combined with their constrained resources and the volume of data generated, introduces a major security concern. WSN applications are extremely critical, it is essential to build reliable solutions that involve fast and continuous mechanisms for online stream analysis, allowing the identification of at-tacks and intrusions. Our aim is to develop an intelligent and efficient intrusion detection system by applying an important machine learning concept known as ensemble learning in order to improve detection performance.

The stringent limitations of the battery of sensor devices and dubious wireless medium incur enormous challenges in the secure data collection and routing. Integration of compressive sensing and cryptography mechanism provide an efficient paradigm for reliable and energy efficient data collection over WSNs. With the aim of reducing communication cost and resilience against different WSN security attacks, this paper proposes a paillier cryptosystem and compressive sensing based routing ((PCSR)-S-2) protocol. To achieve its objective, the proposed (PCSR)-S-2 designs three mechanisms that are paillier cryptosystem based key distribution and management, intra-cluster data gathering, and secure data transmission. Initially, the (PCSR)-S-2 provides paillier security keys to each device for data authentication. Instead of providing a long term security keys among two entities, the lightweight key refreshing mechanism of paillier cryptosystem in (PCSR)-S-2 updates the keys over a specific time interval. Secondly, the design of the Spatio-temporal measurement matrix within the intra-cluster reduces the computation and communication costs considerably. The integration of zero noise factors with all transmitted data assists the BS in detecting and isolating malicious behaviors in the network. Thus, the (PCSR)-S-2 efficiently offers high security in terms of integrity and confidentiality over WSN. We compare (PCSR)-S-2 to existing schemes, CSDA developed in 2017 and CSHEAD in early 2021 which outperform CSDA. The new scheme (PCSR)-S-2 offer better performance for all KPIs and thus is the best model combining data confidentiality and attack detection in WSN",Article;,1868-5137

In this paper, we propose a new variational SR framework based on an automatic selection of the weighting parameter that control the balance between the L-1 and L-2 fidelity terms, which handle different type of noise distributions. Concerning the regularization, we use the combined total variation (TV) and the total variation of the first derivatives (TV2) model with a new implementation of the Primal-dual algorithm to solve the corresponding discretized problem.

The SR techniques strongly depend on the availability of accurate motion estimation. When the estimation of motion is not well established, as usually happens for non-parametric motion, annoying artifacts appear in the super-resolved image. Since SR problems suffer from the motion and blur estimations, new techniques are considered to improve the registration and restoration steps. The proposed method consists of a non-parametric image registration based on diffusion regularization and a nonlocal Laplace regularizer combined with a bilateral filter (BTV) in the reconstruction step to remove noise and motion outliers. The diffusion registration is employed to handle the small deformation between the unregistered images, while the combination of nonlocal Laplace and BTV is used to increase the robustness of the restoration step with respect to the blurring effect and to the noise. We also prove the existence of a solution to the well posed registration problem.

Being able to interpret these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart problems. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction has an important impact in medical diagnostics during the mother pregnancy period. Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in denoising the observed ECG signals using a bilateral total variation (BTV) filter; then minimizing the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the FECG signal from the MECG one.
Results: We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our proposed method. We will consider many examples of independent/dependent source component signals. The results will be compared with those of the classical method called independent component analysis (ICA) under the same conditions. The accuracy of source estimation is evaluated through a criterion, called again the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The first experiment shows that our proposed method gives accurate estimation of sources in the standard case of independent components, with performance around 27 dB in term of SNR. In the second experiment, we show the capability of the proposed algorithm to successfully separate two noisy mixtures of dependent source components - with classical criterion devoted to the independent case - fails, and that our method is able to deal with the dependent case with good performance.
Conclusions: In this work, we focus specifically on the separation of the ECG signal sources taken from skin two electrodes located on a pregnant woman's body. The ECG separation is interpreted as a noisy linear BSS problem with instantaneous mixtures. Firstly, a denoising step is required to reduce the noise due to motion artifacts using a BTV filter as a very effective one-pass filter for denoising. Then, we use the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the fetal heart rate from the mother one, for both independent and dependent cases.",Article,1742-4682

The considered model is a partial differential equation for the surface height profile u which possesses the following free energy functional:
E(u) - integral(Omega) [1/2ln(1+vertical bar del u vertical bar(2)) - vertical bar del u vertical bar arctan(vertical bar del u vertical bar) + 1/2 vertical bar Delta u vertical bar(2)]dx,
where Omega is the domain of a fixed support on which the growth is carried out. The term vertical bar Delta u vertical bar(2) designates the standard surface diffusion in contrast to the second order term which phenomenologically describes the growth instability. The energy above is mainly carried out in regions of higher surface slope (vertical bar del u vertical bar). Hence minimizing such energy corresponds to reducing surface defects during the growth process from a given initial surface configuration. Our analysis is concerned with the energetic and coarsening behaviours of the equilibrium solution. The existence of global energy minimizers and a scaling argument are used to construct a sequence of equilibrium solutions with different wavelength. We apply our minimum energy estimates to derive bounds in terms of the linear system size vertical bar Omega vertical bar for the characteristic interface width and average slope. We also derive a stable numerical scheme based on the convex-concave decomposition of the energy functional and study its properties while accommodating these results with 1d and 2d numerical simulations.",Article;,1937-1632

Vesicles deform under flow, such as a shear flow. Under a linear shear flow, they are known to exhibit several motions that combine orientation and shape deformation (such as tank treading, vacillating breathing, and so on). It is shown here that the equations of motion of a vesicle under shear flow in the weak deformation regime can be mapped onto those of a loaded (or heavy bottom) rigid sphere in five dimensions in fictitious gravitational and shear fields. Based on our previous exact analytical solutions for vesicles (which we extend here to out-of-shear-plane motions), we provide hitherto unrevealed exact explicit solution for the rigid sphere problem. We explain how deformation of a vesicle in real space can be extracted from a rigid body dynamics in five dimensions upon appropriate projection onto a lower dimension. This study offers a framework where rigid spheres and deformable vesicles are recast into the same universality class in which both systems are described by the same formal equations differing only by the space dimension.",Article,2470-0045

To overcome this problem we first proposed in [1] a new approach using Block-based BEMD method (BBEMD) where an input image is subdivided into four subblocks, and then the BEMD is applied on each of the four blocks separately. This method offered a good solution to the calculation time, unfortunately blocking artefact is noticeable in the resulting modes, this is a result of ignoring the interblock correlation during the BEMD process and every block was taken as an independent entity when interpolating the blocks borders in the sifting process. The Lapped Block-based BEMD (LBBEMD) is then proposed to whelm the artefact problem using for every block the neighbouring information by enlarging the block neighbourhood related to the two adjacent blocks inside the image during the blocks decomposition. Enlarging neighbourhood blocks necessitate intensive simulations to have for each block the corresponding enlargement size, thing that affects remarkably on the calculation time. Experimentation shows that the LBBEMD can not handle correctly the artefact problems, because the enlargement size can not be enough ""or too big"" to surround all the concerned pixels for each block in the image. The problem with the LBBEMD is to exactly define, a priori, for each block the size of the neighbouring enlargement size. In this paper, we will present an adaptive and fast Block Empirical mode decomposition to eliminate definitively the artefacts problems when subdividing an image into lapped blocks and we will prove, by simulations, that our method offers a good trade-off between computational time and decomposition quality.",Article,1738-7906

Many mathematical models have been conducted to understand, control, and predict its spread. In this paper we propose a mathematical model with memory effect modelling HIV transmission in a heterosexual population divided into two age classes; young-class (15-24 years old) and grown-class (25 years old and over). The goal of dividing the population according to age is to identify the most vulnerable class to the virus based on their sexual activity and make accurate predictions about HIV transmission. First, we determine the biologically significant space for the study, and we prove the existence of a unique solution. Then we divide the principal model into four sub-models: young-people, grown-people, young-men linked to grown-women, grown-men linked to young-women. The basic reproduction number associated to each sub-model is derived. According to the four sub-models, we have found that, if the basic reproduction number is below unity, then the free disease equilibrium state is locally asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results and discuss the local stability of the endemic equilibrium states of each sub-model. We conclude that incorporating memory conservation gives more realistic results, where reaching a stable state takes higher time.

The evolution equations of the swimmer orientation and its position are nonlinear and analytical results are the exception rather than the rule. Most available results for cell orientation and trajectories are obtained numerically. The solution for the swimmer orientation is inspired from a method due to Bretherton, initially developed for a different nonlinear equation. We show here that this method can be generalized to our evolution equation. We see that the swimmer under flow exhibits both run (a motion where the orientation angle is kept constant with time) and tumble (the orientation angle is cyclic with time) regimes, and a variety of cell trajectories are extracted analytically, such as parabolic, elliptic, and helical.

It implies an analysis be conducted in order to identify and manage the areas at risk of overexposure where an increasing risk to human health is suspected. The development of methods is a prerequisite for implementing public health activities aimed at protecting populations. Methods This paper presents the methodological framework developed by INERIS (French National Institute for Industrial Environment and Risks) to identify a common framework for a structured and operationalized assessment of human exposure. An integrated exposure assessment approach has been developed to integrate the multiplicity of exposure pathways from various sources, through a series of models enabling the final exposure of a population to be defined. Results Measured data from environmental networks reflecting the actual contamination of the environment are used to gauge the population's exposure. Sophisticated methods of spatial analysis are applied to include additional information and take benefit of spatial and inter-variable correlation to improve data representativeness and characterize the associated uncertainty. Integrated approaches bring together all the information available for assessing the source-to-human-dose continuum using a Geographic Information System, multimedia exposure and toxicokinetic model. Discussion One of the objectives of the integrated approach was to demonstrate the feasibility of building complex realistic exposure scenarios satisfying the needs of stakeholders and the accuracy of the modelling predictions at a fine spatial-temporal resolution. A case study is presented to provide a specific application of the proposed framework and how the results could be used to identify an overexposed population. Conclusion This framework could be used for many purposes, such as mapping EHI, identifying vulnerable populations and providing determinants of exposure to manage and plan remedial actions and to assess the spatial relationships between health and the environment to identify factors that influence the variability of disease patterns.",Article,1476-069X

In this study, chlorpyrifos exposure of pregnant women in Picardy was evaluated at a regional scale during 1 year. This approach provided a mapping of exposure indicators of pregnant women to chlorpyrifos over fine spatial and temporal resolutions using a GIS environment.
Methods Fate and transport models (emission, atmospheric dispersion, multimedia exposure, PBPK) were combined with environmental databases in a GIS environment. Quantities spread over agricultural fields were simulated and integrated into a modeling chain coupling models. The fate and transport of chlorpyrifos was characterized by an atmospheric dispersion statistical metamodel and the dynamiCROP model. Then, the multimedia model Modul'ERS was used to predict chlorpyrifos daily exposure doses which were integrated in a PBPK model to compute biomarker of exposure (TCPy urinary concentrations). For the concentration predictions, two scenarios (lower bound and upper bound) were built.
Results At fine spatio-temporal resolutions, the cartography of biomarkers in the lower bound scenario clearly highlights agricultural areas. In these maps, some specific areas and hotspots appear as potentially more exposed specifically during application period. Overall, predictions were close to biomonitoring data and ingestion route was the main contributor to chlorpyrifos exposure.

Vesicles deform under flow, such as a shear flow. Under a linear shear flow, they are known to exhibit several motions that combine orientation and shape deformation (such as tank treading, vacillating breathing, and so on). It is shown here that the equations of motion of a vesicle under shear flow in the weak deformation regime can be mapped onto those of a loaded (or heavy bottom) rigid sphere in five dimensions in fictitious gravitational and shear fields. Based on our previous exact analytical solutions for vesicles (which we extend here to out-of-shear-plane motions), we provide hitherto unrevealed exact explicit solution for the rigid sphere problem. We explain how deformation of a vesicle in real space can be extracted from a rigid body dynamics in five dimensions upon appropriate projection onto a lower dimension. This study offers a framework where rigid spheres and deformable vesicles are recast into the same universality class in which both systems are described by the same formal equations differing only by the space dimension.",Article,2470-0045

In this work our attention is addressed toward the study of a highly nonlinear front evolution equation proposed by Csahok et al.

In the quasispherical limit, two coupled nonlinear equations that describe the vesicle orientation in the flow and its shape evolution were derived [Phys. Rev.

Of special interest is to provide, for the first time, an exact analytical prediction of the time-dependent effective viscosity eta(eff) and normal stress differences N-1 and N-2. Our results shed light on the effect of the viscosity ratio lambda (defined as the inner over the outer fluid viscosities) as the main controlling parameter. It is shown that eta(eff), N-1, and N-2 either tend to a steady state or describe a periodic time-dependent rheological response, previously reported numerically and experimentally. In particular, the shear viscosity minimum and the cusp singularities of eta(eff), N-1, and N-2 at the tumbling threshold are brought to light. We also report on rheology properties for an arbitrary linear flow. We were able to obtain a constitutive law in a closed form relating the stress tensor to the strain rate tensor.

Our goal here is to identify these three modes by obtaining explicit analytical expressions of the vesicle inclination angle and the shape deformation. In particular, the VB regime is put in evidence and the transition dynamics is discussed. Not surprisingly, our finding confirms the Keller-Skalak solutions (for rigid particles) and shows that the VB and TB modes coexist, and whether one prevails over the other depends on the initial conditions.

The formulated denoising problem is posed using a partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization model. The minimized function imposes a Tikhonov regularization on the estimated lambda, while the proposed PDE encompasses two high-order diffusive tensors. The particularity of this PDE is that it does not over-smooth homogeneous regions and preserves sharp edges during the denoising process, even if its degree is high. A new optimization procedure to compute the weighting parameter is also elaborated inspired from the nonsmooth Primal-dual algorithm. This leads to control of the diffusivity rate generated by the two diffusive operators.

Recently, many works have focused on defining a relationship between supervised learning and the well-known inverse problems. However, this connection between the learning problem and the inverse one has been done in the particular case where the inverse problem is reformulated as a minimization problem with a quadratic cost functional (L2 cost functional). Although, it is well known that the cost functional can be L1 or any positive function that measures the gap between the predicted data and the observed one. Indeed, the use of L1 loss function for supervised learning problem gives more consistent results (see Rosasco et al. in Neural Comput 16:1063-1076, 2004). This strengthens the idea of reformulating the inverse problem, associated to machine learning problem, into a minimization problem using L1 functional. However, the L1 loss function is non-differentiable, which precludes the use of standard optimization tools. To overcome this difficulty, we propose in this paper a new technique of approximation based on the reformulation of the associated inverse problem into a minimizing one of a slanting cost functional Chen et al. (MIS Q Manag Inf Syst 36:1165-1188, 2012), which is solved using Tikhonov regularization and Newton's method.

To confirm this, we present some numerical results showing the efficiency of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the numerical experiment validation is made through academic and real-life data.

Which is crucial for building strong machine learning models, but getting this data can be expensive and time-consuming. Active Machine Learning (ActiveML) is a helpful approach because it cleverly picks the most useful pieces of data to learn from. It uses two main ideas: informativeness and representativeness. Typical ActiveML methods used in ER usually depend too much on just one of these ideas, which can make them less effective, especially when starting with very little data. Our research introduces a new combined method that uses both ideas together. We created two versions of this method, called DPQ and STQ, and tested them on eleven different real -world datasets.

The particularity of this PDE is that it does not over-smooth homogeneous regions and preserves sharp edges during the denoising process, even if its degree is high. A new optimization procedure to compute the weighting parameter is also elaborated inspired from the nonsmooth Primal-dual algorithm.

Furthermore, cardiac arrhythmias are intimately related to the signaling ability of cardiac cells, and are caused by signaling defects. Consequently, modeling the electrical activity of the heart, and the complex signaling models that subtend dangerous arrhythmias such as tachycardia and fibrillation, necessitates a quantitative model of action potential (AP) propagation. Yet, many electrophysiological models, which accurately reproduce dynamical characteristic of the action potential in cells, have been introduced. However, these models are very complex and are very time consuming computationally. Consequently, a large amount of research is consecrated to design models with less computational complexity.
Results: This paper is presenting a new model for analyzing the propagation of ionic concentrations and electrical potential in space and time. In this model, the transport of ions is governed by Nernst-Planck flux equation (NP), and the electrical interaction of the species is described by a new cable equation. These set of equations form a system of coupled partial nonlinear differential equations that is solved numerically. In the first we describe the mathematical model.

Grouped under the same ""dead-water"" vocabulary, two wave-making resistance phenomena have been historically reported. The first, the Nansen wave-making drag, generates a stationary internal wake which produces a kinematic drag with a noticeable hysteresis. The second, the Ekman wave-making drag, is characterized by velocity oscillations caused by a dynamical resistance whose origin is still unclear. The latter has been justified previously by a periodic emission of nonlinear internal waves. Here we show that these speed variations are due to the generation of an internal dispersive undulating depression produced during the initial acceleration of the ship within a linear regime. The dispersive undulating depression front and its subsequent whelps act as a bumpy treadmill on which the ship would move back and forth. We provide an analytical description of the coupled dynamics of the ship and the wave, which demonstrates the unsteady motion of the ship. Thanks to dynamic calculations substantiated by laboratory experiments, we prove that this oscillating regime is only temporary: the ship will escape the transient Ekman regime while maintaining its propulsion force, reaching the asymptotic Nansen limit. In addition, we show that the lateral confinement, often imposed by experimental setups or in harbors and locks, exacerbates oscillations and modifies the asymptotic speed.",Article,0027-8424

A new method for the extraction of fetal ECG from the dependent abdominal signals using blind source separation and adaptive noise cancellation techniques,"Ghazdali, A ; Hakim, A ; Laghrib, A ; Mamouni, N ; Raghay, S",NOV 14 2015,THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLINGarrow_drop_down, ELECTROCARDIOGRAM Blind source separation ; Fetal electrocardiogram extraction ; Copula ; Bilateral TV filter ; Dependent sources,13,10.1186/s12976-015-0021-2,"Background: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that records the electrical activity of the heart, and depicts it as a series of graph-like tracings, or waves. Being able to interpret these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart problems. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction has an important impact in medical diagnostics during the mother pregnancy period. Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in denoising the observed ECG signals using a bilateral total variation (BTV) filter; then minimizing the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the FECG signal from the MECG one.
Results: We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our proposed method. We will consider many examples of independent/dependent source component signals. The results will be compared with those of the classical method called independent component analysis (ICA) under the same conditions. The accuracy of source estimation is evaluated through a criterion, called again the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The first experiment shows that our proposed method gives accurate estimation of sources in the standard case of independent components, with performance around 27 dB in term of SNR. In the second experiment, we show the capability of the proposed algorithm to successfully separate two noisy mixtures of dependent source components - with classical criterion devoted to the independent case - fails, and that our method is able to deal with the dependent case with good performance.
Conclusions: In this work, we focus specifically on the separation of the ECG signal sources taken from skin two electrodes located on a pregnant woman's body. The ECG separation is interpreted as a noisy linear BSS problem with instantaneous mixtures. Firstly, a denoising step is required to reduce the noise due to motion artifacts using a BTV filter as a very effective one-pass filter for denoising. Then, we use the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the fetal heart rate from the mother one, for both independent and dependent cases.",Article,1742-4682

The results of the frequency analysis according to the two models shows a predictive priority of the ANN with an average performance criterion of Nash that exceeds 0.9 in the different basins studied. The study reveals that the specificities of the use of ANN compared to the deterministic models in the frequency analysis is that ANN highlights the sensitivity of the extreme river flood to the physiographic variations of each watershed. This feature allows to include the predictions of extreme events in the different basins studied into a single model and makes them more accurate.",Article,1865-0473

It is shown here that the equations of motion of a vesicle under shear flow in the weak deformation regime can be mapped onto those of a loaded (or heavy bottom) rigid sphere in five dimensions in fictitious gravitational and shear fields. Based on our previous exact analytical solutions for vesicles (which we extend here to out-of-shear-plane motions), we provide hitherto unrevealed exact explicit solution for the rigid sphere problem.

In this work our attention is addressed toward the study of a highly nonlinear front evolution equation proposed by Csahok et al.

To achieve such a target, multi-objective optimization methodology is a good approach inasmuch as several types of objective are minimized or maximized simultaneously. In this paper, this technique is implemented on a closed TSEB Model (Norman et al. 1995, Kustas et al. 1999). The main outputs of this model are the latent and sensible heats which are forming with Soil heat the total net radiation to surface. TSEB Model adaptation to semi-arid area was applying to enhance its performance. The Pareto optimization goal is to minimize latent and sensible heats Error while maximizing TSEB Model performance. Two transpiration parameters are selected as design variables (alpha(p) and fg). Decision parameters are optimized using an evolutionary genetic algorithm, called NSGA-2. During summer 2003, the NSGA-2 gives a best Pareto optimum values for (alpha(p)=0.99) and (fg=0.51). Thus, the results obtained here show the faithfully support of NSGA-2 through the calibration and optimization processes.",Article,1223-6934

Furthermore, cardiac arrhythmias are intimately related to the signaling ability of cardiac cells, and are caused by signaling defects. Consequently, modeling the electrical activity of the heart, and the complex signaling models that subtend dangerous arrhythmias such as tachycardia and fibrillation, necessitates a quantitative model of action potential (AP) propagation. Yet, many electrophysiological models, which accurately reproduce dynamical characteristic of the action potential in cells, have been introduced. However, these models are very complex and are very time consuming computationally. Consequently, a large amount of research is consecrated to design models with less computational complexity.
Results: This paper is presenting a new model for analyzing the propagation of ionic concentrations and electrical potential in space and time. In this model, the transport of ions is governed by Nernst-Planck flux equation (NP), and the electrical interaction of the species is described by a new cable equation. These set of equations form a system of coupled partial nonlinear differential equations that is solved numerically. In the first we describe the mathematical model. To realize the numerical simulation of our model, we proceed by a finite element discretization and then we choose an appropriate resolution algorithm.
Conclusions: We give numerical simulations obtained for different input scenarios in the case of suicide substrate reaction which were compared to those obtained in literature. These input scenarios have been chosen so as to provide an intuitive understanding of dynamics of the model. By accessing time and space domains, it is shown that interpreting the electrical potential of cell membrane at steady state is incorrect. This model is general and applies to ions of any charge in space and time domains. The results obtained show a complete agreement with literature findings and also with the physical interpretation of the phenomenon. Furthermore, various numerical experiments are presented to confirm the accuracy, efficiency and stability of the proposed method. In particular, we show that the scheme is second-order accurate in space.",Article,1742-4682

The emergence of temporal database calls for new visual and efficient modeling techniques to facilitate the design of temporal objects. Even though UML is not currently equipped to manage this task, UML and extended extension offered limited means to express time-varying data and temporal constraints over the dynamic behavior of temporal objects. Therefore, the object constraint language (OCL) plays an important role in the elaboration of the correct conceptual schema that allows the definition of the restrictions and the constraints which contain the duplicate and complex expression. In this paper, we present a UML extension enriched by OCL features and Bitemporal dimension to improve the understandability of a UML/OCL model, and its ability to support the temporal attributes and their evolution. The proposed temporal UML/OCL based on Bitemporal data will be translating into their corresponding in a temporal object-Relational database for the purpose of tracking historical information with an efficient manner. An algorithm has been proposed to automate the transformation from the conceptual schema enriched by bitemporal features to temporal object relational database model by following different steps such as classifying and extracting information about classes, relationships and attributes.

This weakness has motivated us to add a pretreatment phase aiming to optimize the most important SQL statements which seem to have the biggest impact on the effectiveness of the transformed queries. Our main contribution is to enrich these rewriting systems by adding an optimization layer that integrate a set of simplification rules of Left, Right and Full Outer Join in order to avoid, firstly unnecessary operations during the conversion process, and secondly SPARQL queries with a high complexity due to Optional patterns obtained from outer join in this conversion context.",Article,2158-107X

The interaction manager integrates and reasons over this information to predict the user's situation and service use.

Multimedia documents adaptive platform using multi-agent system and mobile ubiquitous environment,"Khallouki, H ; Bahaj, M",2017,2017 INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND COMPUTER VISION (ISCV), mobile devices ; multimedia documents ; multi-agent system ; semantic web ; context ; adaptation,1,,"Nowadays, more and more people possess mobile devices (laptops, tablets, smart-phones, etc), capable of creating and sharing documents (which generally are multimedia oriented) via internet anytime and anywhere (home, office, hospital, etc). People should have full control on how they receive a multimedia content, depending on their current condition: when in a meeting, displaying a text instead of audio content is appreciated. Thus, condition changes need to be detected in real-time. In this paper, we present a generic new approach which combines multi-agent system with semantic web services to predict the user current context and enable a dynamic adaptation of multimedia document. Our approach is based on intelligent agents which collect information, determine the user current context and generate a set of adaptive actions.",Proceedings Paper,

In the other hand, the semantic web technologies has emerged with their considerable performance in data management by giving the web information a well-defined meaning, and allowing machines to intelligently access to different data sources. However, there is no bridge or an open extension toward these two systems; in addition, each NoSQL database has its own query language and does not support the standards of other systems (such as semantic web). All these reasons have motivated us to operate in this topic in order to unify the NoSQL query language and contribute in the interoperability of the both world with a specific focus on MongoDB as the most used NoSQL document oriented database by proposing the first provably semantic preserving algorithm named Mongo2SPARQL which transform MongoDB query language queries to its equivalent SPARQL ones based on the grammar of both languages.",Proceedings Paper,

This requires the immersion of meaning in information storage systems. Software agents can qualitatively treat information only if they can understand it, which is possible due to the cooperation of the ontology as source of knowledge and the data sources as an informational heap.
In this paper, we present an automatic approach that allows to create an ontology from a classical data source (Relational, Object Oriented or Semi-Structured), and to interrogate the ontology thus created without resorting to creating instances: To create the ontology, the approach is based basically on meta-model, model and transformation concepts. Indeed, the different stages are translated by the transformation of an input model for the generation of an output model, this generation is directed by meta-models that we proposed. We present also a system of querying ontology without having to populate it with instances from data source. This system provides an intermediate level of abstraction between the ontological model and the data source schemas, this level can generate partially and temporarily the data in XML format. The system also provides a SPARQL-XQUERY mapping which rewrites any SPARQL query at XQUERY query in order to be executed on the generated data.",Proceedings Paper,

The reason why we have conducted this study is the absence of diversity slum mapping in the form of dynamic GIS data, which can be a part of national development strategies to tackle the risk of further proliferation of shantytowns. Therefore, we first create a new database integration from five countries whose content contains 1366 high -resolution patches of 224 x 224 pixels divided into five classes: two types of ""Urban Slum"", one type of ""Rural Slum"", ""Formal Buildings"", and non -built-up area.

Despite feeding the model with an adequate amount of labeled data to mitigate fluctuations during training, the model still suffers from high variance in the final overall accuracy and loss among identical training runs. Many of the reasons behind this are the randomness in data shuffling and augmentation, the behavior of gradient decent function, and the non-determinism in convnet layers and floating-point computation of the GPU.The method used to address the aforementioned issues, specifically in the case of negative transfer learning, is divided into three steps: First, designing an efficient lightweight con-vnet architecture with respect to available resources. Second, mitigating oscillations dur-ing training. Third, after setting the random seed across the training, select the appropri-ate weight initialization.

It can cause serious problems such as suicide. Therefore, early detection is important to stop the progression of this disease that could endanger human lives. Predicting and detecting early-stage depression using machine learning (ML) techniques is a promising strategy. This study's main purpose is to assess which ML techniques are highly appropriate and accurate regarding such diagnoses. Six supervised ML techniques namely: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) were applied on dataset collected from Kaggle and compared for their accuracy (ACC) and performance in predicting depression. The performance of each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated in terms of ACC, F1-score, Precision (PR), and Sensitivity (SEN). Based on the experimental results analysis, we can conclude that SVM and LR performed better than all other methods with an ACC of 83,32%.

However, the complexity of the underlying mechanisms of AI systems can render it difficult for humans to understand and trust AI-driven decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) is a rapidly evolving field that addresses this challenge, providing human-understandable explanations of AI decisions. Based on a systematic literature survey, We explore the latest techniques and approaches that are helping manufacturers gain transparency in the decision-making processes of their AI systems. In this survey, we focus on two of the most exciting areas of XAI: ontology-based and semantic-based XAI (O-XAI, S-XAI, respectively), which provide human-readable explanations of AI decisions by exploiting semantic information. These latter types of explanations are presented in natural language and are designed to be easily understood by non-experts. Translating the decision paths taken by AI algorithms to meaningful explanations through semantics, O-XAI, and S-XAI enables humans to identify various cross-cutting concerns that influence the decisions made by the AI system. This information can be used to improve the performance of the AI system, identify potential biases in the system, and ensure that the decisions are aligned with the goals and values of the manufacturing organization. Additionally, we highlight the benefits and challenges of using O-XAI and S-XAI in manufacturing and discuss the potential for future research, aiming to provide valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners looking to leverage the power of ontologies and general semantics for XAI.",Review;,0956-5515

The symptoms, reactions, and the rate of recovery shown in the coronavirus cases worldwide have been varied. The number of patients is still rising exponentially, and some countries are now battling the third wave. Since the most effective treatment of this disease has not been discovered so far, early detection of potential COVID-19 patients can help isolate them socially to decrease the spread and flatten the curve. In this study, we explore state-of-the-art research on coronavirus disease to determine the impact of this illness among various age groups. Moreover, we analyze the performance of the Decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Naive bayes (NB), Support vector machine (SVM), and Logistic regression (LR) to determine COVID-19 in the patients based on their symptoms. A dataset obtained from a public repository was collected and pre-processed, before applying the selected Machine learning (ML) algorithms on them. The results demonstrate that all the ML algorithms incorporated perform well in determining COVID-19 in potential patients. NB and DT classifiers show the best performance with an accuracy of 93.70%, whereas other algorithms, such as SVM, KNN, and LR, demonstrate an accuracy of 93.60%, 93.50%, and 92.80% respectively.

Despite feeding the model with an adequate amount of labeled data to mitigate fluctuations during training, the model still suffers from high variance in the final overall accuracy and loss among identical training runs. Many of the reasons behind this are the randomness in data shuffling and augmentation, the behavior of gradient decent function, and the non-determinism in convnet layers and floating-point computation of the GPU.The method used to address the aforementioned issues, specifically in the case of negative transfer learning, is divided into three steps: First, designing an efficient lightweight con-vnet architecture with respect to available resources. Second, mitigating oscillations dur-ing training. Third, after setting the random seed across the training, select the appropri-ate weight initialization. Our extensive experiments in the use case of binary slum local-ization and detection show that our method improves the reproducibility of our model from scratch with an accuracy of 98.88 +/- 1.15%, a loss of 0.03 +/- 0.05 for a confidence level of 99.73%.

In this work, the comparison of the ammonium (NH4+) of the 24 h balance with the daily average values of DO and ORP for each basin showed that when the oxygen concentration is low, the NH4+ concentration is high. The maximum NH4+ value of around 10.3 mg N/L is obtained on the day when the DO concentration is almost zero at the level of one of the 4 basins, which is basin B1. Moreover, knowing that the influent flow is unstable, the punctual monitoring of these parameters at the exit of each basin showed that during the mornings the punctual concentrations of NH4+ are generally low in comparison to NO3- concentrations which are high and the measurements of DO and ORP which correspond are important. Conversely, the results obtained during afternoons with high values of NH4+ correspond to low values of DO, ORP and NO3-. This shows that the need for oxygen also fluctuates during the day. In real-time control, the use of key parameters obtained from temporary readings of the DO and ORP profiles provide valuable information on the biological nitrification-denitrification process: The DO breakpoint indicates the disappearance of NH4+ during the aerobic phase (end of nitrification), called DO elbow are break points on ORP profiles; the ORP knee on the ORP profile signifies the control point where the nitrate has been effectively reduced during the non-aeration cycle (the nitrate knee), The oxygen-uptake rate which can reflect the activity of microorganisms. In this work, given the large amount of information provided by the system, these key parameters are used to accurately interpret some aeration/non-aeration cycles within the four basins.",Article;,1944-3994

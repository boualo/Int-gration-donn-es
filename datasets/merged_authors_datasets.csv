However, one aspect that has remained underrepresented is the sentiment analysis of the Moroccan dialect, which boasts a unique linguistic landscape and the coexistence of multiple scripts. Previous works in sentiment analysis primarily targeted dialects employing Arabic script. While these efforts provided valuable insights, they may not fully capture the complexity of Moroccan web content, which features a blend of Arabic and Latin script. As a result, our study emphasizes the importance of extending sentiment analysis to encompass the entire spectrum of Moroccan linguistic diversity. Central to our research is the creation of the largest public dataset for Moroccan dialect sentiment analysis that incorporates not only Moroccan dialect written in Arabic script but also in Latin characters. By assembling a diverse range of textual data, we were able to construct a dataset with a range of 19,991 manually labeled texts in Moroccan dialect and also publicly available lists of stop words in Moroccan dialect as a new contribution to Moroccan Arabic resources. In our exploration of sentiment analysis, we undertook a comprehensive study encompassing various machine-learning models to assess their compatibility with our dataset. While our investigation revealed that the highest accuracy of 98.42% was attained through the utilization of the DarijaBert-mix transfer-learning model, we also delved into deep learning models. Notably, our experimentation yielded a commendable accuracy rate of 92% when employing a CNN model. Furthermore, in an effort to affirm the reliability of our dataset, we tested the CNN model using smaller publicly available datasets of Moroccan dialect, with results that proved to be promising and supportive of our findings.', 'Type de document': 'Article;'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'Improved parameter estimation in epidemic modeling using continuous data assimilation methods', 'Auteurs': 'Azoua, M ; Karim, M ; Azouani, A ; Hafidi, I', 'Date de publication': 'OCT 2024', 'Titre de la source': 'JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTINGarrow_drop_down', 'Mots-clés': ' VACCINATION ; BEHAVIOR Data assimilation ; Nudging ; Parameter recovery ; Inverse problems ; Epidemiological models', 'Nombre de citations': 0, 'DOI': '10.1007/s12190-024-02145-w', 'Résumé': 'In this work, we investigate the numerical performance of a continuous data assimilation algorithm based on ideas from the feedback control theory of dynamical systems, in the context of the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental mathematical model of epidemics.

Particularly, particle swarm optimization (PSO), an evolutionary computing (EC) approach guided by swarm intelligence, has gained widespread adoption owing to its implementation simplicity and potential for global search. This paper analyzes several variants of PSO algorithms and introduces a new FS method called HPSO.

Additionally, it incorporates a chaotic map and a MAD fitness function with a feature count penalty to tackle the clustering FS problem. The efficiency of the developed method is evaluated against the genetic algorithm (GA) and well-known variants of PSO algorithms, including PSOs with fixed inertia weights, PSOs with improved inertia weights, PSOs with fixed constriction factors, PSOs with improved constriction factors, PSOs with adaptive inertia weights, and PSO's includes advanced learning exemplars and sophisticated structure topologies.

Exact methods, such as the Apriori algorithm, are highly effective for dealing with small to medium datasets. However, these methods need more temporal complexity when dealing with large datasets. Metaheuristic-based methods are becoming more rapid, but the majority still need to be more precise. Several studies were carried out to address these issues and improve metaheuristics-based approaches by combining the Apriori algorithm with several metaheuristics algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The result of this combination gave birth to two approaches: GA-Apriori and PSO-Apriori.

WSN applications are extremely critical, it is essential to build reliable solutions that involve fast and continuous mechanisms for online stream analysis, allowing the identification of at-tacks and intrusions. Our aim is to develop an intelligent and efficient intrusion detection system by applying an important machine learning concept known as ensemble learning in order to improve detection performance. Although ensemble models have been proven to be useful in offline learning, they have received less attention in streaming applications. In this paper, we examine the application of different homogeneous and heterogeneous online ensembles in sensory data analy-sis on a specialized WSN detection system (WSN-DS) dataset in order to classify four types of attacks: Blackhole attack, Grayhole, Flooding, and Scheduling among normal network traffic. Among the proposed novel online ensembles, both the het-erogeneous ensemble consisting of an Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) combined with the Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (HAT) algorithm and the homogeneous ensemble HAT made up of 10 models achieved higher detection rates of 96.84 % and 97.2 %, respectively.

The stringent limitations of the battery of sensor devices and dubious wireless medium incur enormous challenges in the secure data collection and routing. Integration of compressive sensing and cryptography mechanism provide an efficient paradigm for reliable and energy efficient data collection over WSNs. With the aim of reducing communication cost and resilience against different WSN security attacks, this paper proposes a paillier cryptosystem and compressive sensing based routing ((PCSR)-S-2) protocol. To achieve its objective, the proposed (PCSR)-S-2 designs three mechanisms that are paillier cryptosystem based key distribution and management, intra-cluster data gathering, and secure data transmission. Initially, the (PCSR)-S-2 provides paillier security keys to each device for data authentication. Instead of providing a long term security keys among two entities, the lightweight key refreshing mechanism of paillier cryptosystem in (PCSR)-S-2 updates the keys over a specific time interval. Secondly, the design of the Spatio-temporal measurement matrix within the intra-cluster reduces the computation and communication costs considerably. The integration of zero noise factors with all transmitted data assists the BS in detecting and isolating malicious behaviors in the network. Thus, the (PCSR)-S-2 efficiently offers high security in terms of integrity and confidentiality over WSN. We compare (PCSR)-S-2 to existing schemes, CSDA developed in 2017 and CSHEAD in early 2021 which outperform CSDA.

The basic LBP method encodes local features by considering the difference in the local neighbourhood to represent a given image using the binary pattern histogram. Without performing the histogram step, the LBP method could be used to detect edges in an image. In this paper, two algorithms for edge detection are proposed. They are based on modifying the principle of the LBP method where a local neighbourhood is coded in binary by integrating a criterion of its homogeneity. In this work, we define this criterion as the ratio of the total variation in the whole image to the local variation of the neighbourhood. Thus, a new approach of edge detection is presented in two versions according to the way of calculating the differences in a neighbourhood. Experimental results on a standard natural image database show that the two proposed algorithms significantly improve the MSE, PSNR and SSIM indicators of the famous Canny detector and the improved LBP approach.

The proposed constrained-PDE is formulated using a variational model that features a L-1 data discrepancy encoding the impulse noise and an L-2 term of the clean image, which is a solution of a high-order PDE. Then, a rigorous analysis of the existence of the solution to the proposed model is checked in a suitable functional framework.

In recent years, many studies have been conducted on image super-resolution (SR). Since the super-resolution techniques depend on the motion precision estimation, we investigate the use of a nonlinear elastic (called hyperelastic) image registration. Also, we propose a spatially weighted second order SR algorithm, which takes into account the distribution of the spatial information in different image areas. The hyperelastic image registration is used to handle the subpixel errors between the unregistered images, while the spatially weighted second order regularization allows to increase the robustness of the restoration step with respect to degradation factors (blur and noise). As a result, the registration model is more efficient and easier to implement and the proposed SR algorithm reduces artifacts in flat regions of the image and also preserves well sharp edges. The efficiency of the proposed model is demonstrated using simulated and real tests, while comparison with other competitive SR methods is achieved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The proposed model differs from existing image variational SR models where the fidelity term is always derived from the L-1 or L-2- norm, and the regularization term is based on a widely choice of convex and nonconvex functions.

Generally, the FIM problem can be solved by either the exact or metaheuristic-based methods. Exact methods, such as the Apriori algorithm, are highly effective for dealing with small to medium datasets. However, these methods need more temporal complexity when dealing with large datasets. Metaheuristic-based methods are becoming more rapid, but the majority still need to be more precise. Several studies were carried out to address these issues and improve metaheuristics-based approaches by combining the Apriori algorithm with several metaheuristics algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The result of this combination gave birth to two approaches: GA-Apriori and PSO-Apriori. Consequently, after performing several studies on different database instances, the results revealed that the two approaches outperformed the Apriori algorithm in terms of runtime. PSO-Apriori also beats GA-Apriori in terms of both runtime and solution efficiency.', 'Type de document': 'Review'}, {'Titre de l’article': None, 'Auteur': None, 'Date de publication': None, 'Titre de la source': None, 'Mots-clés': '', 'Nombre de citations': None, 'DOI': None, 'Résumé': None, 'Type de document': None}, {'Titre de l’article': 'An Enhanced Apriori Algorithm Using Hybrid Data Layout Based on Hadoop for Big Data Processing', 'Auteurs': 'Rochd, Y ; Hafidi, I', 'Date de publication': 'JUN 30 2018', 'Titre de la source': 'INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITYarrow_drop_down', 'Mots-clés': ' ASSOCIATION RULES ; PARALLEL Data mining ; Frequent itemset mining ; Apriori ; Big data ; Hadoop', 'Nombre de citations': 0, 'DOI': None, 'Résumé': 'Frequent itemset mining is one of the data mining methodes implemeted to find frequent patterns, utilized in prediction, association rule mining, classification, etc. Apriori algorithm is an iterative method, that is used to discover frequent itemsets from transactional dataset.

To resolve the problem of treatment dataset in every iteration, we present an algorithm called Hybrid Frequent Itemset Mining on Hadoop (HFIMH) which uses the vertical layout of dataset to solve the problem of treatment the dataset in every iteration. Vertical dataset conveys information to discover support of every itemsets, and the idea of set intersection is utilized to compute it.

Various existing data mining techniques often through mining frequent itemsets derive association rules and access to relevant knowledge, but with the rapid arrival of the era of big data, traditional data mining algorithms have been unable to meet large data's analysis needs. Recently, the PrePost algorithm has been proposed, a new algorithm for mining frequent itemsets based on the idea of N-lists.

Recently, many works have focused on defining a relationship between supervised learning and the well-known inverse problems. However, this connection between the learning problem and the inverse one has been done in the particular case where the inverse problem is reformulated as a minimization problem with a quadratic cost functional (L2 cost functional). Although, it is well known that the cost functional can be L1 or any positive function that measures the gap between the predicted data and the observed one. Indeed, the use of L1 loss function for supervised learning problem gives more consistent results (see Rosasco et al. in Neural Comput 16:1063-1076, 2004). This strengthens the idea of reformulating the inverse problem, associated to machine learning problem, into a minimization problem using L1 functional. However, the L1 loss function is non-differentiable, which precludes the use of standard optimization tools. To overcome this difficulty, we propose in this paper a new technique of approximation based on the reformulation of the associated inverse problem into a minimizing one of a slanting cost functional Chen et al. (MIS Q Manag Inf Syst 36:1165-1188, 2012), which is solved using Tikhonov regularization and Newton's method. This approach leads to an efficient numerical algorithm allowing us to solve supervised learning problem in the most general framework. To confirm this, we present some numerical results showing the efficiency of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the numerical experiment validation is made through academic and real-life data.

To reduce the time complexity of the evolutionary algorithm a variant enhanced by fuzzy logic controllers and performed with a parallel solver is investigated.

The basic LBP method encodes local features by considering the difference in the local neighbourhood to represent a given image using the binary pattern histogram. Without performing the histogram step, the LBP method could be used to detect edges in an image. In this paper, two algorithms for edge detection are proposed. They are based on modifying the principle of the LBP method where a local neighbourhood is coded in binary by integrating a criterion of its homogeneity. In this work, we define this criterion as the ratio of the total variation in the whole image to the local variation of the neighbourhood. Thus, a new approach of edge detection is presented in two versions according to the way of calculating the differences in a neighbourhood. Experimental results on a standard natural image database show that the two proposed algorithms significantly improve the MSE, PSNR and SSIM indicators of the famous Canny detector and the improved LBP approach.

Indeed, DP-WRAP algorithm assigns tasks randomly and does not take into account the cost of migrations which can reach (m-I) migrations in the worst case. Note that recent experiments upon real platforms show that the cost of migrations has an influence on global system performance. Instead of randomly assigning tasks, we have proposed a task assignment algorithm that has reduced significantly the number of migrations of the DP-WRAP. The first step of the proposed algorithm, based on the classical bin-packing heuristics, allows minimizing the number of migrant tasks, the second step consists in assigning efficiently the migrant tasks.

The obtained algorithm achieves separation in a noisy context where standard BSS methods fail. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach are illustrated by numerical simulations.

The SR techniques strongly depend on the availability of accurate motion estimation. When the estimation of motion is not well established, as usually happens for non-parametric motion, annoying artifacts appear in the super-resolved image. Since SR problems suffer from the motion and blur estimations, new techniques are considered to improve the registration and restoration steps. The proposed method consists of a non-parametric image registration based on diffusion regularization and a nonlocal Laplace regularizer combined with a bilateral filter (BTV) in the reconstruction step to remove noise and motion outliers. The diffusion registration is employed to handle the small deformation between the unregistered images, while the combination of nonlocal Laplace and BTV is used to increase the robustness of the restoration step with respect to the blurring effect and to the noise. We also prove the existence of a solution to the well posed registration problem. Simulation results using different images show the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm against noise and outliers compared to other existing methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Being able to interpret these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart problems. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction has an important impact in medical diagnostics during the mother pregnancy period. Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in denoising the observed ECG signals using a bilateral total variation (BTV) filter; then minimizing the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the FECG signal from the MECG one.\nResults: We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our proposed method. We will consider many examples of independent/dependent source component signals. The results will be compared with those of the classical method called independent component analysis (ICA) under the same conditions. The accuracy of source estimation is evaluated through a criterion, called again the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The first experiment shows that our proposed method gives accurate estimation of sources in the standard case of independent components, with performance around 27 dB in term of SNR. In the second experiment, we show the capability of the proposed algorithm to successfully separate two noisy mixtures of dependent source components - with classical criterion devoted to the independent case - fails, and that our method is able to deal with the dependent case with good performance.\nConclusions: In this work, we focus specifically on the separation of the ECG signal sources taken from skin two electrodes located on a pregnant woman's body. The ECG separation is interpreted as a noisy linear BSS problem with instantaneous mixtures. Firstly, a denoising step is required to reduce the noise due to motion artifacts using a BTV filter as a very effective one-pass filter for denoising. Then, we use the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the fetal heart rate from the mother one, for both independent and dependent cases."", 'Type de document': 'Article'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'Blind source separation using measure on copulas', 'Auteurs': 'Ghazdali, A ; Hakim, A', 'Date de publication': 'JUN 2015', 'Titre de la source': 'ANNALS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CRAIOVA-MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE SERIESarrow_drop_down', 'Mots-clés': ' Blind source separation ; instantaneous mixtures ; Copulas ; Kullbak-Leibler divergence', 'Nombre de citations': 0, 'DOI': None, 'Résumé': 'The paper introduces a novel BSS algorithm for instantaneous mixtures of both independent and dependent sources.

Also, we propose a spatially weighted second order SR algorithm, which takes into account the distribution of the spatial information in different image areas. The hyperelastic image registration is used to handle the subpixel errors between the unregistered images, while the spatially weighted second order regularization allows to increase the robustness of the restoration step with respect to degradation factors (blur and noise).

Being able to interpret these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart problems. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction has an important impact in medical diagnostics during the mother pregnancy period. Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in denoising the observed ECG signals using a bilateral total variation (BTV) filter; then minimizing the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the FECG signal from the MECG one.\nResults: We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our proposed method. We will consider many examples of independent/dependent source component signals. The results will be compared with those of the classical method called independent component analysis (ICA) under the same conditions. The accuracy of source estimation is evaluated through a criterion, called again the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The first experiment shows that our proposed method gives accurate estimation of sources in the standard case of independent components, with performance around 27 dB in term of SNR. In the second experiment, we show the capability of the proposed algorithm to successfully separate two noisy mixtures of dependent source components - with classical criterion devoted to the independent case - fails, and that our method is able to deal with the dependent case with good performance.\nConclusions: In this work, we focus specifically on the separation of the ECG signal sources taken from skin two electrodes located on a pregnant woman's body. The ECG separation is interpreted as a noisy linear BSS problem with instantaneous mixtures. Firstly, a denoising step is required to reduce the noise due to motion artifacts using a BTV filter as a very effective one-pass filter for denoising. Then, we use the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the fetal heart rate from the mother one, for both independent and dependent cases."", 'Type de document': 'Article'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'A combined total variation and bilateral filter approach for image robust super resolution', 'Auteurs': 'Laghrib, A ; Hakim, A ; Raghay, S', 'Date de publication': 'JUN 26 2015', 'Titre de la source': 'EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSINGarrow_drop_down', 'Mots-clés': ' RECONSTRUCTION Super resolution ; Bilateral filter ; Bounded variation space ; Total variation ; Function relaxed', 'Nombre de citations': '34', 'DOI': '10.1186/s13640-015-0075-4', 'Résumé': 'In this paper, we consider the image super-resolution (SR) reconstitution problem.

The reason why we have conducted this study is the absence of diversity slum mapping in the form of dynamic GIS data, which can be a part of national development strategies to tackle the risk of further proliferation of shantytowns. Therefore, we first create a new database integration from five countries whose content contains 1366 high -resolution patches of 224 x 224 pixels divided into five classes: two types of ""Urban Slum"", one type of ""Rural Slum"", ""Formal Buildings"", and non -built-up area. Second, we suggest employing a variety of performance metrics to come up with the best transfer learning -based models for the unfreezing stage. The study reveals that by handling the unfreezing of the front layers, we can produce a reliable new model where one condition is fulfilled, namely, where high -frequency dissimilarities have arisen between the target and the source datasets. Quantitative results of these methodologies show that our dataset and our unfreezing strategy for the mobilenetv2 model are more accurate compared to other competing models. This new model can localize all possible changes in morphology and shape among the threeslum types with state-of-the-art performance that reaches an overall accuracy of 98.17%, a loss of 0.062, and a kappa score of 97.71%.

Several issues associated with big data were addressed as a result of the rise of this new generation of data services. However, in the rush to address the problems of big data and vast numbers of active users, NoSQL dropped certain of the core features of databases that make them highly performant and usable such as the global view, that permits users to access data without needing to know how they are logically organized or physically stored in their sources. We address, in this article, the challenge of how to fill the gap between NoSQL and the Semantic web, in order to enable access to such databases and integration of non-relational data sources. However, we extend the well-known framework for ontology-based data access (OBDA), intending to allow a mediating ontology to query arbitrary databases.

The reason why we have conducted this study is the absence of diversity slum mapping in the form of dynamic GIS data, which can be a part of national development strategies to tackle the risk of further proliferation of shantytowns. Therefore, we first create a new database integration from five countries whose content contains 1366 high -resolution patches of 224 x 224 pixels divided into five classes: two types of ""Urban Slum"", one type of ""Rural Slum"", ""Formal Buildings"", and non -built-up area.

The study reveals that by handling the unfreezing of the front layers, we can produce a reliable new model where one condition is fulfilled, namely, where high -frequency dissimilarities have arisen between the target and the source datasets. Quantitative results of these methodologies show that our dataset and our unfreezing strategy for the mobilenetv2 model are more accurate compared to other competing models.

It can cause serious problems such as suicide. Therefore, early detection is important to stop the progression of this disease that could endanger human lives. Predicting and detecting early-stage depression using machine learning (ML) techniques is a promising strategy. This study's main purpose is to assess which ML techniques are highly appropriate and accurate regarding such diagnoses. Six supervised ML techniques namely: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) were applied on dataset collected from Kaggle and compared for their accuracy (ACC) and performance in predicting depression. The performance of each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated in terms of ACC, F1-score, Precision (PR), and Sensitivity (SEN). Based on the experimental results analysis, we can conclude that SVM and LR performed better than all other methods with an ACC of 83,32%. Therefore, we found that a simple ML algorithm can be used to assist clinicians and practitioners predict depression at an early stage, with excellent potential utility and a considerable degree of ACC."", 'Type de document': 'Article'}]","[{'issn': '0952-8091', 'scope': 'IJCAT addresses issues of computer applications, information and communication systems, software engineering and management, CAD/CAM/CAE, numerical analysis and simulations, finite element methods and analyses, robotics, computer applications in multimedia and new technologies, computer aided learning and training.

The reason why we have conducted this study is the absence of diversity slum mapping in the form of dynamic GIS data, which can be a part of national development strategies to tackle the risk of further proliferation of shantytowns. Therefore, we first create a new database integration from five countries whose content contains 1366 high -resolution patches of 224 x 224 pixels divided into five classes: two types of ""Urban Slum"", one type of ""Rural Slum"", ""Formal Buildings"", and non -built-up area. Second, we suggest employing a variety of performance metrics to come up with the best transfer learning -based models for the unfreezing stage. The study reveals that by handling the unfreezing of the front layers, we can produce a reliable new model where one condition is fulfilled, namely, where high -frequency dissimilarities have arisen between the target and the source datasets. Quantitative results of these methodologies show that our dataset and our unfreezing strategy for the mobilenetv2 model are more accurate compared to other competing models. This new model can localize all possible changes in morphology and shape among the threeslum types with state-of-the-art performance that reaches an overall accuracy of 98.17%, a loss of 0.062, and a kappa score of 97.71%.

Despite feeding the model with an adequate amount of labeled data to mitigate fluctuations during training, the model still suffers from high variance in the final overall accuracy and loss among identical training runs. Many of the reasons behind this are the randomness in data shuffling and augmentation, the behavior of gradient decent function, and the non-determinism in convnet layers and floating-point computation of the GPU.The method used to address the aforementioned issues, specifically in the case of negative transfer learning, is divided into three steps: First, designing an efficient lightweight con-vnet architecture with respect to available resources. Second, mitigating oscillations dur-ing training. Third, after setting the random seed across the training, select the appropri-ate weight initialization. Our extensive experiments in the use case of binary slum local-ization and detection show that our method improves the reproducibility of our model from scratch with an accuracy of 98.88 +/- 1.15%, a loss of 0.03 +/- 0.05 for a confidence level of 99.73%.

In this work, the comparison of the ammonium (NH4+) of the 24 h balance with the daily average values of DO and ORP for each basin showed that when the oxygen concentration is low, the NH4+ concentration is high. The maximum NH4+ value of around 10.3 mg N/L is obtained on the day when the DO concentration is almost zero at the level of one of the 4 basins, which is basin B1. Moreover, knowing that the influent flow is unstable, the punctual monitoring of these parameters at the exit of each basin showed that during the mornings the punctual concentrations of NH4+ are generally low in comparison to NO3- concentrations which are high and the measurements of DO and ORP which correspond are important. Conversely, the results obtained during afternoons with high values of NH4+ correspond to low values of DO, ORP and NO3-. This shows that the need for oxygen also fluctuates during the day. In real-time control, the use of key parameters obtained from temporary readings of the DO and ORP profiles provide valuable information on the biological nitrification-denitrification process: The DO breakpoint indicates the disappearance of NH4+ during the aerobic phase (end of nitrification), called DO elbow are break points on ORP profiles; the ORP knee on the ORP profile signifies the control point where the nitrate has been effectively reduced during the non-aeration cycle (the nitrate knee), The oxygen-uptake rate which can reflect the activity of microorganisms.

Vesicles deform under flow, such as a shear flow. Under a linear shear flow, they are known to exhibit several motions that combine orientation and shape deformation (such as tank treading, vacillating breathing, and so on). It is shown here that the equations of motion of a vesicle under shear flow in the weak deformation regime can be mapped onto those of a loaded (or heavy bottom) rigid sphere in five dimensions in fictitious gravitational and shear fields. Based on our previous exact analytical solutions for vesicles (which we extend here to out-of-shear-plane motions), we provide hitherto unrevealed exact explicit solution for the rigid sphere problem. We explain how deformation of a vesicle in real space can be extracted from a rigid body dynamics in five dimensions upon appropriate projection onto a lower dimension.

Furthermore, cardiac arrhythmias are intimately related to the signaling ability of cardiac cells, and are caused by signaling defects. Consequently, modeling the electrical activity of the heart, and the complex signaling models that subtend dangerous arrhythmias such as tachycardia and fibrillation, necessitates a quantitative model of action potential (AP) propagation. Yet, many electrophysiological models, which accurately reproduce dynamical characteristic of the action potential in cells, have been introduced. However, these models are very complex and are very time consuming computationally. Consequently, a large amount of research is consecrated to design models with less computational complexity.\nResults: This paper is presenting a new model for analyzing the propagation of ionic concentrations and electrical potential in space and time. In this model, the transport of ions is governed by Nernst-Planck flux equation (NP), and the electrical interaction of the species is described by a new cable equation. These set of equations form a system of coupled partial nonlinear differential equations that is solved numerically. In the first we describe the mathematical model. To realize the numerical simulation of our model, we proceed by a finite element discretization and then we choose an appropriate resolution algorithm.\nConclusions: We give numerical simulations obtained for different input scenarios in the case of suicide substrate reaction which were compared to those obtained in literature. These input scenarios have been chosen so as to provide an intuitive understanding of dynamics of the model. By accessing time and space domains, it is shown that interpreting the electrical potential of cell membrane at steady state is incorrect. This model is general and applies to ions of any charge in space and time domains. The results obtained show a complete agreement with literature findings and also with the physical interpretation of the phenomenon. Furthermore, various numerical experiments are presented to confirm the accuracy, efficiency and stability of the proposed method.

The emergence of temporal database calls for new visual and efficient modeling techniques to facilitate the design of temporal objects. Even though UML is not currently equipped to manage this task, UML and extended extension offered limited means to express time-varying data and temporal constraints over the dynamic behavior of temporal objects. Therefore, the object constraint language (OCL) plays an important role in the elaboration of the correct conceptual schema that allows the definition of the restrictions and the constraints which contain the duplicate and complex expression. In this paper, we present a UML extension enriched by OCL features and Bitemporal dimension to improve the understandability of a UML/OCL model, and its ability to support the temporal attributes and their evolution. The proposed temporal UML/OCL based on Bitemporal data will be translating into their corresponding in a temporal object-Relational database for the purpose of tracking historical information with an efficient manner. An algorithm has been proposed to automate the transformation from the conceptual schema enriched by bitemporal features to temporal object relational database model by following different steps such as classifying and extracting information about classes, relationships and attributes.

This framework offers a communication and integration infrastructure between distributed multi-agent systems as a more effective alternative to the widely used TCP/IP.\nDifferent types of middleware have addressed issues of interoperability. we based our framework on one of the most widely adopted middleware architectures used in attaching heterogeneous systems that is Message Oriented Middleware (MOM). MOM is an acronym referring to a middleware function related to reliable queuing and message based communications. Is known as common connect technology for heterogeneous software systems.', 'Type de document': 'Proceedings Paper'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'Multimodal Context based-adaptive Architecture for multimedia documents', 'Auteurs': 'Khallouki, H ; Bahaj, M', 'Date de publication': '2015', 'Titre de la source': '2015 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIONS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IIT)', 'Mots-clés': ' Multimedia documents ; heterogeneity of devices ; multimodality ; interaction ; multimodal architecture ; ubiquitous computing', 'Nombre de citations': '2', 'DOI': None, 'Résumé': ""Multimedia documents can be accessed at anytime and anywhere on a wide variety of devices, such as laptops, tablets and smartphones.

An automated diagnosis system should be built for early detection because manual breast cancer diagnosis takes a long time. Doctors have lately achieved significant advances in the early identification and treatment of breast cancer in order to decrease the rate of mortality caused by the latter. Researchers, on the other hand, are analysing large amounts of complicated medical data by employing a combination of statistical and machine learning methodologies to assist clinicians in predicting breast cancer. Various machine learning approaches, including ontology-based Machine Learning methods, have lately played an essential role in medical science by building an automated system that can identify breast cancer. This study examines and evaluates the most popular machine learning algorithms, besides the ontological model based on Machine Learning. Among the classification methods investigated were Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbours. The dataset utilized has 683 instances and is available for download from the Kaggle website. The findings are assessed using performance measures generated from the confusion matrix, such as F-Measure, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. The ontology model surpassed all machine learning techniques, according to the results.', 'Type de document': 'Article'}, {'Titre de l’article': 'The Impact of Ontology on the Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease Compared to Machine Learning Algorithms', 'Auteurs': 'El Massari, H ; Gherabi, N ; Mhammedi, S ; Ghandi, H ; Bahaj, M ; Naqvi, MR', 'Date de publication': '2022', 'Titre de la source': 'INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONLINE AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERINGarrow_drop_down', 'Mots-clés': ' cardiovascular ; ontology ; swrl ; prediction ; machine learning', 'Nombre de citations': '6', 'DOI': '10.3991/ijoe.v18i11.32647', 'Résumé': 'Cardiovascular disease is one of the chronic diseases that is on the rise.

This has led to the appearance of a variety of data systems to store and process RDF data. To help users identify the best suited RDF data stores for their needs, we establish a list of evaluation and comparison criteria of existing RDF management systems also called triplestores. This is the first work addressing such topic for such triplestores.

The emergence of temporal database calls for new visual and efficient modeling techniques to facilitate the design of temporal objects. Even though UML is not currently equipped to manage this task, UML and extended extension offered limited means to express time-varying data and temporal constraints over the dynamic behavior of temporal objects. Therefore, the object constraint language (OCL) plays an important role in the elaboration of the correct conceptual schema that allows the definition of the restrictions and the constraints which contain the duplicate and complex expression. In this paper, we present a UML extension enriched by OCL features and Bitemporal dimension to improve the understandability of a UML/OCL model, and its ability to support the temporal attributes and their evolution. The proposed temporal UML/OCL based on Bitemporal data will be translating into their corresponding in a temporal object-Relational database for the purpose of tracking historical information with an efficient manner. An algorithm has been proposed to automate the transformation from the conceptual schema enriched by bitemporal features to temporal object relational database model by following different steps such as classifying and extracting information about classes, relationships and attributes.

With the emergence of mobile devices, distant learning is passing from electronic learning (e-learning) to mobile learning (m-learning) which makes learning even more widely available. This availability has put emphasis on the need of having platforms that are delivering learning contents corresponding to learner's learning environment. With the huge amount of learning materials available on the internet, it's become difficult to find the suitable ones. Although, recommendation systems can be the solution for this problem. However, these systems are still less used in e-learning and mlearning in comparison with other fields (e-commerce, social media...). Hence, to make these systems more relevant and performant, in this paper we propose to take benefits from semantic web technologies by proposing to add a semantic layer in 3-tiers classical web application's architecture. This layer will hold three ontologies: The Learning Context Ontology is a domain knowledge for gathering the learning context information (Profile, Social interactions, learning activities, and device specifications), The Learning Content Ontology is the Learning Object Ontology, and the Learning Design Ontology is the ontology to hold the sequenced learning activities.

It's these lacks that proposes the Web Ontology Language (OWL) proposes to fill. In fact, OWL is a language for ontologies representation in the context of Semantic Web (SW). It's in this context that we're obliged to come up with a solution that allows migration to the SW in order to follow the WEB evolution.\nAmong the suggested solutions, our approach models and implements a set of rules that allow transforming an XML Schema Definition (XSD) to Ontology.

However, there is no bridge or an open extension toward these two systems; in addition, each NoSQL database has its own query language and does not support the standards of other systems (such as semantic web).

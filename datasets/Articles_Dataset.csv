A multi-frame super-resolution using diffusion registration and a nonlocal variational image restoration,Computers & Mathematics with Applications,"In this paper, we present a new approach of multi-frame super-resolution (SR). The SR techniques strongly depend on the availability of accurate motion estimation. When the estimation of motion is not well established, as usually happens for non-parametric motion, annoying artifacts appear in the super-resolved image. Since SR problems suffer from the motion and blur estimations, new techniques are considered to improve the registration and restoration steps. The proposed method consists of a non-parametric image registration based on diffusion regularization and a nonlocal Laplace regularizer combined with a bilateral filter (BTV) in the reconstruction step to remove noise and motion outliers. The diffusion registration is employed to handle the small deformation between the unregistered images, while the combination of nonlocal Laplace and BTV is used to increase the robustness of the restoration step …",08981221,3.084
A new method for the extraction of fetal ECG from the dependent abdominal signals using blind source separation and adaptive noise cancellation techniques,Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling,"Background
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that records the electrical activity of the heart, and depicts it as a series of graph-like tracings, or waves. Being able to interpret these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart problems. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction has an important impact in medical diagnostics during the mother pregnancy period. Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in …",17424682,1.389
New blind source separation method of independent/dependent sources,Signal Processing,"We introduce a new blind source separation approach, based on modified Kullback–Leibler divergence between copula densities, for both independent and dependent source component signals. In the classical case of independent source components, the proposed method generalizes the mutual information (between probability densities) procedure. Moreover, it has the great advantage to be naturally extensible to separate mixtures of dependent source components. Simulation results are presented showing the convergence and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.",01651684,4.235
A multi-frame super-resolution based on new variational data fidelity term,Applied Mathematical Modelling,"The main idea of multi-frame super-resolution (SR) algorithm is to recover a single high-resolution (HR) image from a sequence of low resolution ones of the same scene. Since the restoration step of super-resolution algorithms is always an ill-posed problem, the choice of the fidelity term and the regularization are always crucial. In this paper, we propose a new variational SR framework based on an automatic selection of the weighting parameter that control the balance between the L1 and L2 fidelity terms, which handle different type of noise distributions. Concerning the regularization, we use the combined total variation (TV) and the total variation of the first derivatives (TV2) model with a new implementation of the Primal-dual algorithm to solve the corresponding discretized problem. The obtained results are compared with some competitive algorithms and confirm that the proposed method has much benefices …",0307904X,5.175
Blind noisy mixture separation for independent/dependent sources through a regularized criterion on copulas,Signal Processing,"The paper introduces a new method for Blind Source Separation (BSS) in noisy instantaneous mixtures of both independent or dependent source component signals. This approach is based on the minimization of a regularized criterion. Precisely, it consists in combining the total variation method for denoising with the Kullback–Leibler divergence between copula densities. The latter takes advantage of the copula to model the structure of the dependence between signal components. The obtained algorithm achieves separation in a noisy context where standard BSS methods fail. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach are illustrated by numerical simulations.",01651684,4.235
Digital document image restoration using a blind source separation method based on copulas,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"In the last few decades, digital image degradation issues, such as blur and noise due to the scanning process or the presence of spots, underwriting, overwriting or bleed-through/show-through effects on the image's background has been a popular research field. To solve this problem, many background removal methods has been introduced in the literature which are based on local or adaptive filters in order to deal with the low-contrast issue. For this paper, we will be focusing on the bleed-through/show-through effects, which is already resolved in literature by an analogy between the front-ground and the background of the image, that is to say, a recognition of two images is required. To fix that problem, we suggest a new restoration method using blind source separation based on copulas theory that models the dependency structure, with the aim of improving text readability and OCR efficiency.","17426588, 17426596",0.563
A new convolutive source separation approach for independent/dependent source components,Digital Signal Processing,"In this paper, a new source separation approach, for linear convolutive mixtures of independent/dependent source components, is presented. It consists in minimizing an appropriate separation criterion, measuring the difference between the nonparametric copula density of the estimated sources and semiparametric copula densities modeling the dependency structure of the source components. The proposed approach represents an efficient tool for separating linear convolutive mixtures, especially, when the source components are statistically dependent, if prior information about the dependency structure of the source components is available.","10512004, 10954333",3.54
Blind separation of instantaneous mixtures of independent/dependent sources,"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing","Blind Source Separation (BSS) has always been an active research field within the signal processing community; it is used to reconstruct primary source signals from their observed mixtures. Independent Component Analysis has been and is still used to solve the BSS problem; however, it is based on the mutual independence of the original source signals. In this paper, we propose to use Copulas to model the dependency structure between these signals, enabling the separation of dependent source components; we also deploy -divergence as our cost function to minimize, considering its superiority to handle noisy data as well as its ability to converge faster.

Robust approach for blind separation of noisy mixtures of independent and dependent sources,Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis,"The framework of this article is to introduce a new efficient Blind Source Separation (BSS) method that handles mixtures of noise-contaminated independent / dependent sources. In order to achieve that, one can minimize a criterion that fuses a separating part, based on Kullback–Leibler divergence to set apart the observed mixtures of either dependent or independent sources, with a regularization part that employs the bilateral total variation (BTV) for the purpose of denoising the observations. The proposed algorithm utilizes a primal-dual algorithm to remove the noise, while a gradient descent method is implemented to retrieve the source signals. Our algorithm has shown its effectiveness and efficiency toward the noisy dependent / independent sources and also surpassed the standard BSS algorithms through different experimental results.","10635203, 1096603X",2.734
Multiframe super‐resolution based on a high‐order spatially weighted regularisation,IET Image Processing,"Here, the authors propose a spatially weighted super‐resolution (SR) algorithm, which takes into consideration the distribution of every information that characterise different image areas. The authors investigate to use a combined spatially weighted regularisation of the bilateral total variation and a second‐order term increasing then the robustness of the proposed SR approach with respect to blur and noise degradations. In addition, the authors propose an iterative Bregman iteration algorithm to resolve the obtained optimisation SR problem. As a result, this regularisation is more efficient and easier to implement; moreover, it preserves well the smooth regions of the image and also sharp edges. Using different simulated and real tests, the authors prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to some SR methods.","17519659, 17519667",2.818
A blind poisson–gaussian noise separation using learning copula densities,"Circuits, systems, and signal processing","This paper develops a novel copula denoising optimization solution for separating Poisson noise from images, or removing mixtures of Poisson and Gaussian noise. The proposed approach is elaborated in two steps: first, a spatial bilateral total variation (BTV) regularization is used to reduce Gaussian noise; second, a learning copula procedure is employed to separate the Poisson noise from the ideal image. This leads to capture different image features while significantly reducing the noise. Analytically, we include results on the approximation of the Poisson component as well as the resolution of the proposed optimization model. In addition, to resolve the BTV minimization problem, we proposed an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. Finally, numerical results are provided to remove noise while preserving important details and features, along with convincing comparisons to demonstrate the …","0278081X, 15315878",2.204

Poisson noise and Gaussian noise separation through copula theory,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"This study explores an innovative optimization problem in copula denoising, aiming to distinguish and eliminate both Poisson noise and Gaussian noise.

Then, it implements a Hellinger distance copula separation procedure to separate the Poisson noise from the pristine image. This dual-step approach ensures that crucial image features are preserved while significantly reducing noise levels.

Blind source separation using hellinger divergence and copulas,RAIRO-Operations Research,"Whenever there is a mixture of signals of any type, e.g. sounds, images or any other form of source signals, Blind Source Separation (BSS) is the method utilized to separate these signals from the observations. The separation is done without any prior knowledge about the mixing process nor the source signals. In literature multiple algorithms have been deployed for this particular problem, however most of them depends on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and its variations assuming the statistical independence of the sources. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm improving the separation quality for both independent and dependent sources. Our algorithm used copulas to accurately model the dependency structure and the Hellinger divergence as a distance measure since it can convergence faster and it is robust against noisy source signals.

Blind Source Separation for Text Mining,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"Blind Source Separation (BSS) was originally developed for signal processing applications. It has been proven out that Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which is the technique used for separating independent sources, is a powerful tool for analyzing text document data as well, if the text documents are presented in a suitable numerical form.

Oscillations Induced by Quiescent Adult Female in a Reaction–Diffusion Model of Wild Aedes Aegypti Mosquitoes,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"This paper takes the reaction–diffusion approach to deal with the quiescent females phase, so as to describe the dynamics of invasion of aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are divided into three subpopulations: eggs, pupae and female. We mainly investigate whether the time of quiescence (delay) in the females phase can induce Hopf bifurcation. By means of analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum, we show that the persistent positive equilibrium is asymptotically stable in the absence of time delay, but loses its stability via Hopf bifurcation when time delay crosses some critical value. Using normal form and center manifold theory, we investigate the stability of the bifurcating branches of periodic solutions and the direction of the Hopf bifurcation. Numerical simulations are carried out to support our theoretical results.","02181274, 17936551",2.088

In the current paper, we present a delayed mathematical model describing the dynamics of Ae. aegypti. Our model is governed by a system of three delay differential equations modeling the interactions between three compartments of the Ae. aegypti life cycle (females, eggs and pupae). By using time delay as a parameter of bifurcation, we prove stability/switch stability of the possible equilibrium points and the existence of bifurcating branch of small amplitude periodic solutions when time delay crosses some critical value.

1. Introduction and mathematical model. Yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and zika are dangerous diseases which still lack a cure, and they are spreading through a specific type of vector, the Ae. aegypti mosquito (called also yellow fever mosquito or stegomyia aegypti). The dynamics of Ae. aegypti are particularly impacted by climatic conditions like high temperature and frequent precipitation and the most affected areas are the ones with tropical climates which are favorable to its growth. However, if current studies and predictions about global climate change are now occurring, many new areas might start facing these diseases threat (see [15, 16, 35, 24, 3]).

A survey on constructing Lyapunov functions for reaction-diffusion systems with delay and their application in biology,Mathematical modeling and computing,"Motivated by some biological and ecological problems given by reaction-diffusion systems with delays and boundary conditions of Neumann type and knowing their associated Lyapunov functions for delay ordinary differential equations, we consider a method for determining their Lyapunov functions to establish the local/global stability. The method is essentially based on adding integral terms to the corresponding Lyapunov function for ordinary differential equations. The new approach is not general but it is applicable in a wide variety of delays reaction-diffusion models with one discrete delay or more, distributed delay, and a combination of both of them. To illustrate our results, we present the method application to a reaction-diffusion epidemiological model with time delay (latency period) and indirect transmission effect.","23129794, 24153788",1.099

"Optimal control of chikungunya disease: larvae reduction, treatment and prevention",Mathematical Biosciences & Engineering,"Since the 1980s, there has been a worldwide re-emergence of vectorborne diseases including Malaria, Dengue, Yellow fever or, more recently, chikungunya.

The nature of these arboviruses is complex since it conjugates human, environmental, biological and geographical factors. Recent researchs have suggested, in particular during the Réunion Island epidemic in 2006, that the transmission by Aedes albopictus (an Aedes genus specie) has been facilitated by genetic mutations of the virus and the vector capacity to adapt to non tropical regions.

Synchronization of chaos,Laboratory Diagnostics. Eastern Europe,"Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon characteristic of many processes in natural systems and (nonlinear) science. It has permanently remained an objective of intensive research and is today considered as one of the basic nonlinear phenomena studied in mathematics, physics, engineering, or life science. This word has a Greek root, syn= common and chronos= time, which means to share the common time or to occur at the same time, that is, correlation or agreement in time of different processes (Boccaletti et al. 2002).

Indeed, it is well known that many coupled oscillators have the ability to adjust some common relation that they have between them due to weak interaction, which yields to a situation in which a synchronization-like phenomenon takes place.

"Difference equations versus differential equations, a possible equivalence for the Rössler system?",Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"When a set of nonlinear differential equations is investigated, most of time there is no analytical solution and only numerical integration techniques can provide accurate numerical solutions. In a general way the process of numerical integration is the replacement of a set of differential equations with a continuous dependence on the time by a model for which the time variable is discrete. In numerical investigations a fourth-order Runge–Kutta integration scheme is usually sufficient. Nevertheless, sometimes a set of difference equations may be required and, in this case, standard schemes like the forward Euler, backward Euler or central difference schemes are used.

It is found that the dynamical analysis can be safely performed when a single species involved in the food chain is counted if many thousands of observations are available. If not, a global model can be obtained from the available data and subsequently used to produce all the data required for a detailed analysis.

Canard phenomenon in a slow-fast modified Leslie–Gower model,Mathematical Biosciences,Geometrical Singular Perturbation Theory has been successful to investigate a broad range of biological problems with different time scales. The aim of this paper is to apply this theory to a predator-prey model of modified Leslie–Gower type for which we consider that prey reproduces mush faster than predator. This naturally leads to introduce a small parameter ϵ which gives rise to a slow-fast system. This system has a special folded singularity which has not been analyzed in the classical work [15]. We use the blow-up technique to visualize the behavior near this fold point P. Outside of this region the dynamics are given by classical regular and singular perturbation theory. This allows to quantify geometrically the attractive limit-cycle with an error of O(ϵ) and shows that it exhibits the canard phenomenon while crossing P.,"00255564, 18793134",2.197
Diffusion driven instability and Hopf bifurcation in spatial predator-prey model on a circular domain,Applied Mathematics and Computation,"In this paper, we investigate theoretically and numerically a 2-D spatio-temporal dynamics of a predator-prey mathematical model which incorporates the Holling type II and a modified Leslie–Gower functional response and logistic growth of the prey.

Optimal intervention strategies for tuberculosis,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"This paper deals with the problem of optimal control of a deterministic model of tuberculosis (abbreviated as TB for tubercle bacillus). We first present and analyze an uncontrolled tuberculosis model which incorporates the essential biological and epidemiological features of the disease. The model is shown to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, where a stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with one or more stable endemic equilibria when the associated basic reproduction number is less than the unity. Based on this continuous model, the tuberculosis control is formulated and solved as an optimal control problem, indicating how control terms on the chemoprophylaxis and detection should be introduced in the population to reduce the number of individuals with active TB. Results provide a framework for designing the cost-effective strategies for TB with two intervention methods.",10075704,3.864
On a Coupled Time-Dependent SIR Models Fitting with New York and New-Jersey States COVID-19 Data,Journal of Biological Chemistry,"This article describes a simple Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model fitting with COVID-19 data for the month of March 2020 in New York (NY) state. The model is a classical SIR, but is non-autonomous; the rate of susceptible people becoming infected is adjusted over time in order to fit the available data. The death rate is also secondarily adjusted. Our fitting is made under the assumption that due to limiting number of tests, a large part of the infected population has not been tested positive. In the last part, we extend the model to take into account the daily fluxes between New Jersey (NJ) and NY states and fit the data for both states. Our simple model fits the available data, and illustrates typical dynamics of the disease: exponential increase, apex and decrease. The model highlights a decrease in the transmission rate over the period which gives a quantitative illustration about how lockdown policies reduce the spread of the pandemic. The coupled model with NY and NJ states shows a wave in NJ following the NY wave, illustrating the mechanism of spread from one attractive hot spot to its neighbor.","00219258, 1083351X",4.003

We focus on the existence and properties of a folded singularity, called folded saddle node of type II (FSN II), that allows the emergence of MMOs in the presence of a suitable global return mechanism. As FSN II corresponds to a transcritical bifurcation for a desingularized reduced system, we prove that, under certain non-degeneracy conditions, such a transcritical bifurcation exists. We then apply this result to the case of two coupled systems of FitzHugh–Nagumo type. This leads to a non-trivial condition on the coupling that enables the existence of MMOs.","09517715, 13616544",1.685
Knowledge diffusion in complex networks,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,"Modern communication networks and social networks are the main tunnels of knowledge diffusion. Knowledge diffusion in complex networks is different from the epidemic‐like information spreading, because individuals are willing to learn and spread knowledge to their friends and the learning process can hardly be achieved in a few conversations. In this paper, we investigate the important issue as what topological structure is suitable for knowledge diffusion. We propose a new knowledge diffusion model, where both learning and forgetting mechanisms are considered. In this model, individuals can play imparter and learner simultaneously. Comparing knowledge diffusion on a series of complex topologies, we observe that the individuals with a large degree can quickly learn more knowledge, who are beneficial to knowledge diffusion.

A network model for control of dengue epidemic using sterile insect technique,Mathematical Biosciences & Engineering,"In this paper, a network model has been proposed to control dengue disease transmission considering host-vector dynamics in n patches. The control of mosquitoes is performed by SIT. In SIT, the male insects are sterilized in the laboratory and released into the environment to control the number of offsprings. The basic reproduction number has been computed. The existence and stability of various states have been discussed. The bifurcation diagram has been plotted to show the existence and stability regions of diseasefree and endemic states for an isolated patch. The critical level of sterile male mosquitoes has been obtained for the control of disease. The basic reproduction number for n patch network model has been computed. It is evident from numerical simulations that SIT control in one patch may control the disease in the network having two/three patches with suitable coupling among them.
1. Introduction. Dengue is a vector-borne disease spread by the female mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The mosquitoes Aedes aegypti were originated from Africa but have now been spread in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world. The fast growth in human population, uncontrolled urbanization and inadequate waste management systems have led to abundance of mosquito breeding sites [6]. These are the main causes which bring this global distribution of mosquitoes and consequently spread of the mosquito-borne diseases. Before 1970, dengue was reported from only nine countries, now it has been widespread in the areas of North America, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia","15471063, 15510018",2.404

We prove the existence of the global attractor and the L∞-bound for networks of n reaction-diffusion systems that belong to a class that generalizes the FitzHugh-Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations.
1. Introduction. Networks of dynamical systems appear naturally in the modeling of numerous applications. In this paper, we focus on reaction-diffusion (RD) systems networks that can be seen as neural networks. More precisely, in the network, each node is a RD system which models the electrical activity of one neuron or a group of neurons. RD systems which we consider here belong to a class that generalizes the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) equations. Recall that Fitzugh-Nagumo equations are a two dimensional simplification of the four dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) equations, that were introduced in 1952 to model action potential propagation in the squid giant axon, and awarded with the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine [7, 10, 17]. In the network, the coupling between nodes represent the synaptic activity which can be either electrical or chemical. A classical question in dynamical systems is the existence of the attractor: basically, a set that attracts all the trajectories for large time. This is the question we deal with, by proving the existence of the network global attractor, whatever the topology (ie graph connectivity which here, represents the synaptic connectivity) of the network is. The existence of the attractor and the L∞-bound appear crucially in the related article [4] in which we study the synchronization phenomena for these networks …","15313492, 1553524X",1.467

1. Introduction and mathematical model. In the last decades, the dynamical problems of prey and predator associated with mathematical modelling becomes an important area of research in ecology. An important orientation in theoretical work on preypredator dynamics has been to acquire more realistic models, trying to keep to maximum the unavoidable increase in complexity of their mathematics. One of the oldest and well known mathematical model which describes the interaction between predator and prey was introduced by A. Lotka 1925 [13] and V. Volterra 1927 [18], this model is well known by Lotka-Volterra mathematical model. It consists of two differential equations with a simple correspondence between prey consumption and predator production. The link between the dynamics of the two species in predator-prey model is based on a linear functional response type, which represents the number of prey consumed per predator per unit of time.

Opinion diffusion in two-layer interconnected networks,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,"In reality, individuals will spread their opinions by word of mouth, meanwhile sharing their opinions on social platforms. To gain a clear insight into this kind of behavior, we propose a diffusion model of various opinions in a two-layer interconnected network using some statistical characteristics of network structures. Theoretical analysis reveals that the final fraction of any opinion in one layer will get identical to that of the same opinion in the other layer. In particular, when the seed fraction of an opinion in one layer is different from that in the other layer, the diffusion behavior and final prevalence of opinions not only rely on the seed fractions of opinions, but also depend on the attributes of individuals that are active on different layers, including their inter-layer linking patterns and linking number. Further analysis shows that mass media will promote the spread of the opinion that is in accordance with its own. Finally, we …",15498328,5.886

In this scenario, a new strategy equilibrium emerges in the system. We define this equilibrium as a local Nash equilibrium. In this paper, we present an explicit definition of the local Nash equilibrium for the two-strategy games in structured populations.

The main result of this paper is to establish an explicit algorithm for determining the direction of this Hopf bifurcation and the stability or instability of the bifurcating branch of periodic solutions, using the methods presented by O.

Non-trivial dynamics in the Fizhugh–Rinzel model and non-homogeneous oscillatory-excitable reaction-diffusions systems,Journal of Biological Chemistry,"Simple Summary
This article provides original numerical and mathematical insights about the FHR model and non-homogeneous FitzHugh–Nagumo reaction-diffusion systems.
Abstract
This article focuses on the qualitative analysis of complex dynamics arising in a few mathematical models in neuroscience context. We first discuss the dynamics arising in the three-dimensional FitzHugh–Rinzel (FHR) model and then illustrate those arising in a class of non-homogeneous FitzHugh–Nagumo (Nh-FHN) reaction-diffusion systems. FHR and Nh-FHN models can be used to generate relevant complex dynamics and wave-propagation phenomena in neuroscience context. Such complex dynamics include canards, mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), Hopf-bifurcations and their spatially extended counterpart. Our article highlights original methods to characterize these complex dynamics and how they emerge in ordinary differential equations and spatially extended models.","00219258, 1083351X",4.003
Dimension estimate of attractors for complex networks of reaction-diffusion systems applied to an ecological model,Commun. Pur. Appl. Anal,"The asymptotic behavior of dissipative evolution problems, determined by complex networks of reaction-diffusion systems, is investigated with an original approach. We establish a novel estimation of the fractal dimension of exponential attractors for a wide class of continuous dynamical systems, clarifying the effect of the topology of the network on the large time dynamics of the generated semi-flow. We explore various remarkable topologies (chains, cycles, star and complete graphs) and discover that the size of the network does not necessarily enlarge the dimension of attractors. Additionally, we prove a synchronization theorem in the case of symmetric topologies. We apply our method to a complex network of competing species systems modeling an heterogeneous biological ecosystem and propose a series of numerical simulations which underpin our theoretical statements.
1. Introduction. In this article, we aim to bring a novel contribution to the study of the asymptotic behavior of dissipative evolution problems, by establishing an innovative estimation of the dimension of their possible attractors. We focus on evolution problems determined by complex networks of reaction-diffusion systems. Those complex networks can be constructed in concordance with a finite graph, whose vertices are associated with non-identical instances of a given reaction-diffusion system, as will be shown below. Under reasonable assumptions which cover a wide class of systems, we show that such complex networks generate continuous dynamical systems whose asymptotic behavior can be described by a family of exponential attractors of finite fractal dimension …",15340392,1.101

Bifurcations and synchronization in networks of unstable reaction–diffusion systems,Journal of Nonlinear Science,"This article is devoted to the analysis of the dynamics of a complex network of unstable reaction–diffusion systems. We demonstrate the existence of a non-empty parameter regime for which synchronization occurs in non-trivial attractors. We establish a lower bound of the dimension of the global attractor in an innovative manner, by proving a novel theorem of continuity of the unstable manifold, for which we invoke a principle of spectrum perturbation of non-bounded operators. Finally, we exhibit a co-dimension 2 bifurcation of the unstable manifold which shows that synchronization is compatible with instabilities.","09388974, 14321467",2.5

Modeling and analysis of the impact of risk culture on human behavior during a catastrophic event,Sustainability,"In a world more and more affected by natural and/or industrial disasters, it is essential to understand, analyze and control human behavior during such events. The work presented in this article is one of the results of a transdisciplinary collaboration between geographers, psychologists, mathematicians, computer scientists, operational staff and stakeholders in risk management. This collaboration made it possible to identify the diverse behavioral reactions that can occur during a disaster and to propose a categorization of these behavioral states and their transitions. These behavioral dynamics are described by the APC (Alert–Panic–Control) mathematical model, which integrates two key elements (among others) during disasters: cognition and social contagion.

The model is governed by a system of delay differential equations where the delay represents the time that the cancer cell take to proliferate. Our analytical study of the stability shows that by considering the time delay as a parameter of bifurcation, it is possible to have stability switch and oscillations through a Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, by introducing the drug intervention term, the critical delay value increases. This indicates that the system can tolerate a longer delay before oscillations start.

In the absence of cross-diffusion, we establish well posedness of the problem, non-negativity and boundedness of solutions, nonexistence of positive solutions, local and global stability of the nontrivial steady-state and the nonoccurrence of Turing instability. In the presence of cross-diffusion, we prove the occurrence of Turing instability by using the cross-diffusion coefficient of infected cells as a parameter.

Predator–prey dynamics with seasonal water-level fluctuations,Journal of Biological Systems,"Water level in rivers, lakes and reservoirs has great influence on the interactions between prey and predator fish. Indeed, the increase of the water volume hinders the capture of the prey by the predator. The same reasoning applies when there is a decrease in the volume of water, favoring the capture of the prey by the predator. In this paper, we consider a seasonally varying predator–prey model to study the influence of water-level variations on the interaction between two species of fishes in an artificial lake. A seasonal variation of the water-level is introduced in the predation rate taking into account two values, leading to a general switched system. Permanence, stability and existence of an invariant domain containing at least one periodic solution are established.

Study of the Effect of Rescuers and the Use of a Massive Alarm in a Population in a Disaster Situation,Sustainability,"Faced with an ongoing or imminent danger, crisis managers must do their utmost to protect the exposed population and limit the extent of the disaster. More than during the pre- and post-disaster phases, time is of the essence. This temporal specificity of the disaster is essential compared to the risk. It requires a perfect coordination and a quick response in a context of uncertainty. It is important to intervene rapidly on the scene of the disaster while ensuring there are enough first responders. Crisis managers must also quickly alert the population at risk in order to favor the adoption of protective behaviors and limit inappropriate reactions, panic phenomena, and the spread of rumors. In France, in the event of a danger affecting the population, the intervention of law enforcement and emergency services is relatively rapid, even though there may be differences depending on the territories (urban or rural). On the contrary, the triggering of the alert by institutional actors (the mayor or the prefect, depending on the extent of the disaster) must follow a strict procedure that imposes longer delays and may limit or even neutralize its effectiveness. This article proposes a theoretical reflection on the effectiveness of these two types of intervention (relief and warning) with affected populations in the case of rapid kinetic or unpredictable events affecting people with a low risk culture. This reflection is based on the mathematical model “alert, panic, control” (APC) inspired by models used in epidemiology. It enables the modeling of behavior dynamics by distinguishing control and panic behaviors resulting from the difficulty or incapacity to regulate emotions. Several …",20711050,3.953
Optimal networks for exact controllability,International Journal of Modern Physics C,"The exact controllability can be mapped to the problem of maximum algebraic multiplicity of all eigenvalues.

Gaining Profound Knowledge of Cholera Outbreak: The Significance of the Allee Effect on Bacterial Population Growth and Its Implications for Human-Environment Health,Sustainability,"Cholera is a bacterial disease that is commonly transmitted through contaminated water, leading to severe diarrhea and rapid dehydration that can prove fatal if left untreated. The complexity of the disease spread arises from the convergence of several distinct and interrelated factors, which previous research has often failed to consider. A significant scientific limitation of the existing literature is the simplistic assumption of linear or logistic dynamics of the disease spread, thereby impeding a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of control strategies. Since environmental factors are the most influential determinant of Vibrio bacterial growth in nature and are responsible for the resurgence, propagation, and disappearance of cholera epidemics, we have proposed a S-I-R-S model that combines bacterial dynamics with the Allee effect. This model takes into account the environmental influence and allows for a better understanding of the disease dynamics. Our results have revealed the phenomenon of bi-stability, with backward and forward bifurcation. Furthermore, our findings have demonstrated that the Allee effect provides a robust framework for characterizing fluctuations in bacterial populations and the onset of cholera outbreaks. This framework can be used for assessing the effectiveness of control strategies, including regular environmental sanitation programs, adherence to hygiene protocols, and monitoring of unfavorable weather conditions.",20711050,3.953

These biochemical neuronal networks are extraordinarily complex and highly nonlinear. To ferret out these interactions is a problem for biologists, but understanding how biochemical networks coordinate cellular responses is also a problem in applied Mathematics and Computational Biology.
The computation of the mathematical neuronal model may give clues to how neurons function smoothly in the brain. In the presence of neuronal disorders like Parkinson’s disease, epileptic seizures, and even schizophrenia, mathematical models give insufficient information and in these cases a data-driven approach is more helpful. Recently, neurophysiological experiments allow collection of EEG data to identify coherent brain structures during sensory information processing. Being so relevant, it necessitates bringing further development in this subject of research with a dedicated Research Topic. This Research Topic, therefore, plans to assemble original results along with reviews on the aspects of brain function modeling at the level of neurons and their networks through computation and data-driven approaches.",16625188,2.388

Secure access control to data in off-chain storage in blockchain-based consent systems,Mathematics,"Data access control is a crucial aspect of data management. Actors who want to share data need systems to manage consent in order to decide who can access their data. This guarantees the privacy of data, which is often sensitive. As a secure distributed ledger, the blockchain is widely used today to manage consent for data access. However, a blockchain is not ideal for storing large volumes of data due to its characteristics. Therefore, it is often coupled with off-chain systems to facilitate the storage of these kinds of data. Therefore, data located outside the blockchain require security procedures. This article proposes a securing mechanism based on data encryption to secure data in off-chain storage in blockchain-based consent systems. The protocol uses a symmetric key system, which prevents the reading of data stored outside the sphere of the blockchain by malicious actors who would have access. The mechanism’s set up allows each set of data to be encrypted with a symmetric key that is anchored in a blockchain. This key is then used by the actors who have obtained the consent of the data owner to access and read the data stored outside the blockchain.",22277390,2.617

Numerical simulations highlight that the market can absorb strong mono-shocks but can also be led to rupture by low but repeated perturbations.","02181274, 17936551",2.088

We use Laplace’s demon as a reference for formulating these visions. Vision 1 breaks Laplace’s dream by exhibiting fundamental difficulties in mathematics, physics and computer sciences hampering to derive systemic properties from the knowledge of components characteristics and their interactions rules. Vision 2 reactivates Laplace’s dream, with new demons based on increased computation power and big data availability, yet subject to the limitation identified by vision 1. Finally, vision 3 challenges Laplace’s demon to simulate subjectivity, counterfactuals, empathy and their cascading collective effects.","12401307, 17652979",0.184
Close returns plots for detecting a chaotic source in an interaction network,Artificial Life Conference Proceedings,We are interested in studying the spread of chaos in an interaction network modeled by a Coupled Map Network (CMN). This graph is formed by nodes characterized by a measurable state variable that may exhibit chaotic time series. The interaction between the nodes may propagate their states in the network leading through a coupling process to some synchronization phenomenon which is known as nonlinear oscillator synchronization.,-,153.0
Managing Spatial Self-organization via collective behaviors,ESM'2008,"Spatial self-organizations appear in many natural and articial systems. Spatial systems creation and devel- opment, called morphogenesis, is the subject of many research studies since many years (1). Fractal compu- tation approach is, for exemple, one of the methods proposed to deal with such studies. But, even if this method is able to describe unlimited local formations on multi-scale descriptions, the formation process itself is described in a global way. The goal of this paper is to introduce the distributed and decentralized com- puting as a general methodology to propose emergent spatial formation, able to deal with local perturbations and with non homegeneous formation rules.

URBAN CULTURAL DYNAMICS MODELLING USING SWARM INTELLIGENCE AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS,ESM'2008,"This paper deals with the understanding of collective cultural shape dynamics within urban area. The cul- tural facilities inside the city are various and follow com- plex spatial mecanisms. Both geographical aspects and social factors are major in these dynamics, leading to specic equipment. The complexity of these phenom- ena which are the basis of the cultural development, needs some specic modelling technics. In a rst step, we propose some analysis and description of the cultural activity distribution based on a specic geographical in- formation system (GIS). A case study is developped for the french city of Rouen in Normandy. In a second step, and respecting the complexity of the studied systems, we propose to use swarm intelligence models over this GIS to model the urban cultural dynamics. The goal is a better understanding of the relevent interactions within multi-criteria interactions.",-,153.0
Emergent property of consistent updated geographical database,"International Journal of Modelling, Identification and Control","Geographic Information Systems (GIS) will be expected in the future to evolve as to integrate social simulations or ecological processes inside complex systems of active and interactive entities. In a more practical aspect, GIS has now to evolve to manage updating. We will explain how the updating processes can be described as an evolution processes for GIS and make them transform from complicated systems to complex systems. This evolution process is decomposed through an influence table which corresponds to elementary canonical operations. In addition to these updating elementary operations, we verify, during the process, the maintenance of the whole Geographical Database (GDB) using a constraint based system. Our goal is to make the updating satisfying the global consistent property which emerges from the computation over the whole evolutive system.

An Approach for Anomaly Detection in Network Communications Using k-Path Analysis,Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy,"In this paper, we present an innovative approach inspired by the Path-scan model to detect paths with k adjacent edges (k-path) exhibiting unusual behavior (synonymous with anomaly) within network communications. This work is motivated by the challenge of identifying malicious activities carried out in vulnerable k-path in a small to medium-sized computer network. Each observed edge (time series of the number of events or the number of packets exchanged between two computers in the network) is modeled using the three-state observed Markov model, as opposed to the Path-scan model which uses a two-state model (active state and inactive state), to establish baselines of behavior in order to detect anomalies. This model captures the typical behavior of network communications, as well as patterns of suspicious activity, such as those associated with brute force attacks. We take a perspective by analyzing each vulnerable k-path, enabling the accurate detection of anomalies on the k-path. Using this approach, our method aims to enhance the detection of suspicious activities in computer networks, thus providing a more robust and accurate solution to ensure the security of computer systems.","25721046, 25721054",0.667

This algorithm is based on the concept of artificial ants that move together in a complex manner with simple localization rules.

Control on System Diffusion Using Genetic Automata,ESM'2007,"Complex systems \citep{Moigne1999} are models which describe dynamic organizations or systems where the internal interaction network between their components does not allow the control of individual components with efficience.

"The Use of Reduced Models to Generate Irregular, Broad-Band Signals That Resemble Brain Rhythms",Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience,"The brain produces rhythms in a variety of frequency bands. Some are likely by-products of neuronal processes; others are thought to be top-down. Produced entirely naturally, these rhythms have clearly recognizable beats, but they are very far from periodic in the sense of mathematics. The signals are broad-band, episodic, wandering in amplitude and frequency; the rhythm comes and goes, degrading and regenerating. Gamma rhythms, in particular, have been studied by many authors in computational neuroscience, using reduced models as well as networks of hundreds to thousands of integrate-and-fire neurons. All of these models captured successfully the oscillatory nature of gamma rhythms, but the irregular character of gamma in reduced models has not been investigated thoroughly. In this article, we tackle the mathematical question of whether signals with the properties of brain rhythms can be generated from low dimensional dynamical systems. We found that while adding white noise to single periodic cycles can to some degree simulate gamma dynamics, such models tend to be limited in their ability to capture the range of behaviors observed. Using an ODE with two variables inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Leslie-Gower models, with stochastically varying coefficients designed to control independently amplitude, frequency, and degree of degeneracy, we were able to replicate the qualitative characteristics of natural brain rhythms. To demonstrate model versatility, we simulate the power spectral densities of gamma rhythms in various brain states recorded in experiments.",16625188,2.388

From the Lotka–Volterra model to a spatialised population-driven individual-based model,Ecological modelling,"The modelling of predator–prey dynamics is of great importance in ecology. Models based on differential equations aim to understand the interactions between populations of prey and predators at population scale, but they are unable to handle spatial and individual behaviour heterogeneities (individual scale). In this study, a population-driven individual-based model is proposed that has been developed from the archetypical Lotka–Volterra model. The population scale was retained for processes with slower dynamics, such as reproduction for both species and the natural death of predators. The individual scale was only used for the predation process, defining local rules for individual movements of prey and predators (related to a perception distance of predators and the presence of shelters for prey in the spatial environment) and to locate births and deaths. This model was compared with the Lotka–Volterra …","03043800, 18727026",2.868
The importance of being hybrid for spatial epidemic models: a multi-scale approach,Systems,"This work addresses the spread of a disease within an urban system, defined as a network of interconnected cities. The first step consists of comparing two different approaches: a macroscopic one, based on a system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) systems exploiting populations on nodes and flows on edges (so-called metapopulational model), and a hybrid one, coupling ODE SIR systems on nodes and agents traveling on edges. Under homogeneous conditions (mean field approximation), this comparison leads to similar results on the outputs on which we focus (the maximum intensity of the epidemic, its duration and the time of the epidemic peak). However, when it comes to setting up epidemic control strategies, results rapidly diverge between the two approaches, and it appears that the full macroscopic model is not completely adapted to these questions. In this paper, we focus on some control strategies, which are quarantine, avoidance and risk culture, to explore the differences, advantages and disadvantages of the two models and discuss the importance of being hybrid when modeling and simulating epidemic spread at the level of a whole urban system.",10495258,51317.0
Systematic generation of biophysically detailed models with generalization capability for non-spiking neurons,PloS one,"Unlike spiking neurons which compress continuous inputs into digital signals for transmitting information via action potentials, non-spiking neurons modulate analog signals through graded potential responses. Such neurons have been found in a large variety of nervous tissues in both vertebrate and invertebrate species, and have been proven to play a central role in neuronal information processing. If general and vast efforts have been made for many years to model spiking neurons using conductance-based models (CBMs), very few methods have been developed for non-spiking neurons. When a CBM is built to characterize the neuron behavior, it should be endowed with generalization capabilities (i.e. the ability to predict acceptable neuronal responses to different novel stimuli not used during the model’s building). Yet, since CBMs contain a large number of parameters, they may typically suffer from a lack of such a capability. In this paper, we propose a new systematic approach based on multi-objective optimization which builds general non-spiking models with generalization capabilities. The proposed approach only requires macroscopic experimental data from which all the model parameters are simultaneously determined without compromise. Such an approach is applied on three non-spiking neurons of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a well-known model organism in neuroscience that predominantly transmits information through non-spiking signals. These three neurons, arbitrarily labeled by convention as RIM, AIY and AFD, represent, to date, the three possible forms of non-spiking neuronal responses of C …",19326203,3.107
A simple model of nonspiking neurons,Neural Computation,"Due to the ubiquity of spiking neurons in neuronal processes, various simple spiking neuron models have been proposed as an alternative to conductance-based models (a.k.a.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no equivalent in the literature of a simple and lightweight model for describing the voltage behavior of nonspiking neurons, which also are ubiquitous in a large variety of nervous tissues in both vertebrate and invertebrate species and play a central role in information processing. This letter proposes a simple model that reproduces the experimental qualitative behavior of known types of nonspiking neurons. The proposed model, which differs fundamentally from classic simple spiking models unable to characterize nonspiking dynamics due to their intrinsic structure, is derived from …","08997667, 1530888X",2.819
Hopf bifurcations in directed acyclic networks of linearly coupled Hindmarsh–Rose systems,Acta biotheoretica,"This paper addresses the existence of Hopf bifurcations in a directed acyclic network of neurons, each of them being modeled by a Hindmarsh–Rose (HR) neuronal model. The bifurcation parameter is the small parameter corresponding to the ratio of time scales between the fast and the slow dynamics.

Numerical simulations are carried out to observe these bifurcations and to illustrate the theoretical results.","00015342, 15728358",1.75
Construction of MDS block diffusion matrices for block ciphers and hash functions,ENCE China Inf. ENCES,"Block ciphers are one of the most important building blocks in many cryptosystems. Modern block ciphers are often iterations with several rounds, where each round comprises a (nonlinear) confusion layer and a (linear) diffusion layer. The diffusion layer plays a significant role in block ciphers as well as in other cryptographic primitives such as hash functions. The security of a diffusion layer is measured by its differential branch number and the linear branch number. If the two branch numbers are larger, the diffusion layer is stronger at resisting differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis. The diffusion layers with the optimal branch numbers are referred to as maximum distance separable (MDS)(refer to [1–3]). Constructing diffusion layers with large branch numbers is a challenge for cryptosystem designers.
There are two types of diffusion layer according to the underlying fields, where the first is over extension fields of the finite field GF (2), and the second type comprises block matrices over GF (2). In fact, the former is a special case of the latter. In [4] and [5], the second type of diffusion layer was considered, ie, block matrices where every block is a polynomial in a certain block L.

Agent-based spatial model coupling using a coordination unit.,WOA,"Modeling complex systems like soil functioning turns out to be a challenge due to its heterogeneous structure, the number of interactions and processes entangled with each other at various levels and scales. Its heterogeneous structure requires a spatially explicit account, by coupling models through the space by using its resources, as proposed by the spatial model coupling approaches. However, these approaches raise the problem of resource conflicts: interacting models can modify resources simultaneously while the amount available cannot supply models demands. As spatial model coupling approaches do not provide proper resource distribution methods to handle that matter, inconsistencies might occur if resource conflicts are poorly managed. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel coupling approach based on agent paradigm in which the space, associated with a coordination unit supports model exchange and conflict management. This architecture is illustrated by an UML Class Diagram that we implemented into the GAMA platform. To prove its effectiveness, we test the approach on a simple soil model in which numerous models compete for resources scattered in the space. Comparative results suggest that handling conflicts using the coordination unit shows more precise indications of resource use, compared to the model in which conflicts are mismanaged.",-,153.0

It is well known that a free group can be ordered by means of its lower central series [10].

Our algorithm does not make use of the lower central series of the group, but directly of the reason why it has free quotients, ie the injectivity of the Magnus transformation.

Sweedler’s duals and Schützenberger’s calculus,Combinatorics and Physics,"We describe the problem of Sweedler’s duals for bialgebras as essentially characterizing the domain of the transpose of the multiplication. This domain is the set of what could be called “representative linear forms” which are the elements of the algebraic dual which are also representative on the multiplicative semigroup of the algebra. When the algebra is free, this notion is indeed equivalent to that of rational functions of automata theory. For the sake of applications, the range of coefficients has been considerably broadened, ie extended to semirings, so that the results could be specialized to the boolean and multiplicity cases. This requires some caution (use of “positive formulas”, iteration replacing inversion, stable submodules replacing finite-rank families for instance). For the theory and its applications has been created a rational calculus which can, in return, be applied to harness Sweedler’s duals. A new theorem of rational closure and application to Hopf algebras of use in Physics and Combinatorics is provided. The concrete use of this “calculus” is eventually illustrated on an example.","23085827, 23085835",1.472

Möbius inversion formula for monoids with zero,Semigroup Forum,"The Möbius inversion formula, introduced during the 19th century in number theory, was generalized to a wide class of monoids called locally finite such as the free partially commutative, plactic and hypoplactic monoids for instance. In this contribution are developed and used some topological and algebraic notions for monoids with zero, similar to ordinary objects such as the (total) algebra of a monoid, the augmentation ideal or the star operation on proper series. The main concern is to extend the study of the Möbius function to some monoids with zero, i.e., with an absorbing element, in particular the so-called Rees quotients of locally finite monoids. Some relations between the Möbius functions of a monoid and its Rees quotient are also provided.","00371912, 14322137",0.778

(Pure) transcendence bases in φ-deformed shuffle bialgebras,Seminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire,"Computations with integro-differential operators are often carried out in an associative algebra with unit and they are essentially non-commutative computations. By adjoining a cocommutative co-product, one can have those operators perform on a bialgebra isomorphic to an enveloping algebra. That gives an adequate framework for a computer-algebra implementation via monoidal factorization, (pure) transcendence bases and Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt bases. In this paper, we systematically study these deformations, obtaining necessary and sufficient conditions for the operators to exist, and we give the most general cocommutative deformations of the shuffle co-product and an effective construction of pairs of bases in duality. The paper ends by the combinatorial setting of systems of local systems of coordinates on the group of group-like series. * The present work is part of a series of papers devoted to the study of the renormalization of divergent polyzetas (at positive and at non-positive indices) via the factorization of the non commutative generating series of polylogarithms and of harmonic sums and via the effective construction of pairs of dual bases in duality in ϕ-deformed shuffle algebras.

Among the different measures introduced, a Shannon entropy was found to be correlated with the inverse of the largest Lyapunov exponent. The discrepancy between this and the usual interpretation of a Shannon entropy is solved here by using a new definition—still based on the recurrence plots—and it is verified that this new definition is correlated with the largest Lyapunov exponent, as expected from the Pesin conjecture.

Comparisons are done for the equations of motion, the strange attractors that they generate, and the branched manifolds that classify these strange attractors.

How tumor growth can be influenced by delayed interactions between cancer cells and the microenvironment?,BioSystems,"Although recent advances in oncology emphasized the role of microenvironment in tumor growth, the role of delays for modeling tumor growth is still uncertain. In this paper, we considered a model, describing the interactions of tumor cells with their microenvironment made of immune cells and host cells, in which we inserted, as suggested by the clinicians, two time delays, one in the interactions between tumor cells and immune cells and, one in the action of immune cells on tumor cells. We showed analytically that the singular point associated with the co-existence of the three cell populations loses its stability via a Hopf bifurcation. We analytically calculated a range of the delays over which tumor cells are inhibited by immune cells and over which a period-1 limit cycle induced by this Hopf bifurcation is observed. By using a global modeling technique, we investigated how the dynamics observed with two delays …","03032647, 18728324",2.099
Evidence for low dimensional chaos in sunspot cycles,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Sunspot cycles are widely used for investigating solar activity. In 1953 Bracewell argued that it is sometimes desirable to introduce the inversion of the magnetic field polarity, and that can be done with a sign change at the beginning of each cycle. It will be shown in this paper that, for topological reasons, this so-called Bracewell index is inappropriate and that the symmetry must be introduced in a more rigorous way by a coordinate transformation. The resulting symmetric dynamics is then favourably compared with a symmetrized phase portrait reconstructed from the z-variable of the Rössler system. Such a link with this latter variable – which is known to be a poor observable of the underlying dynamics – could explain the general difficulty encountered in finding evidence of low-dimensional dynamics in sunspot data.","00046361, 14320746",4.613

A key feature of this procedure is that the original time series is first transformed into a symmetrical space where the dynamics of the solar dynamo are unfolded in a better way, thus improving the model. The nonlinear model obtained is parsimonious and has both deterministic and stochastic parts. Monte Carlo simulation of the whole model produces very consistent results with the deterministic part of the model but allows for the determination of confidence bands.

Global models from the Canadian lynx cycles as a direct evidence for chaos in real ecosystems,Journal of mathematical biology,"Real food chains are very rarely investigated since long data sequences are required. Typically, if we consider that an ecosystem evolves with a period corresponding to the time for maturation, possessing few dozen of cycles would require to count species over few centuries. One well known example of a long data set is the number of Canadian lynx furs caught by the Hudson Bay company between 1821 and 1935 as reported by Elton and Nicholson in 1942. In spite of the relative quality of the data set (10 undersampled cycles), two low-dimensional global models that settle to chaotic attractors were obtained. They are compared with an ad hoc 3D model which was proposed as a possible model for this data set. The two global models, which were estimated with no prior knowledge about the dynamics, can be considered as direct evidences of chaos in real ecosystems.","03036812, 14321416",2.145

Topological characterization of reconstructed attractors modding out symmetries,Journal de Physique II,"Topological chaxacterization is important in understanding the subtleties of chaotic behaviour.

Investigating embedding in low-dimensional spaces is, therefore, particularly meaningful. This paper is devoted to tridimensional systems which are reconstructed in a state space whose dimension is also 3.

"Structural, dynamical and symbolic observability: From dynamical systems to networks",PLoS One,"Classical definitions of observability classify a system as either being observable or not. Observability has been recognized as an important feature to study complex networks, and as for dynamical systems the focus has been on determining conditions for a network to be observable. About twenty years ago continuous measures of observability for nonlinear dynamical systems started to be used. In this paper various aspects of observability that are established for dynamical systems will be investigated in the context of networks. In particular it will be discussed in which ways simple networks can be ranked in terms of observability using continuous measures of such a property. Also it is pointed out that the analysis of the network topology is typically not sufficient for observability purposes, since both the dynamics and the coupling of such nodes play a vital role.

Constraining the topology of neural networks to ensure dynamics with symmetry properties,Physical Review E,"This paper addresses the training of network models from data produced by systems with symmetry properties. It is argued that although general networks are global approximators, in practice some properties such as symmetry are very hard to learn from data. In order to guarantee that the final network will be symmetrical, constraints are developed for two types of models, namely, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and the radial basis function (RBF) network. In global modeling problems it becomes crucial to impose conditions for symmetry in order to stand a chance of reproducing symmetry-related phenomena. Sufficient conditions are given for MLP and RBF networks to have a set of fixed points that are symmetrical with respect to the origin of the phase space. In the case of MLP networks such conditions reduce to the absence of bias parameters and the requirement of odd activation functions. This turns …","24700045, 24700053",2.266

How the choice of the observable may influence the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"A great number of techniques developed for studying nonlinear dynamical systems start with the embedding, in a d-dimensional space, of a scalar time series, lying on an m-dimensional object, d>m. In general, the main results reached at are valid regardless of the observable chosen. In a number of practical situations, however, the choice of the observable does influence our ability to extract dynamical information from the embedded attractor. This may arise in standard problems in nonlinear dynamics such as model building, control theory and synchronization. To some degree, ease of success will thus depend on the choice of observable simply because it is related to the observability of the dynamics. Investigating the Rössler system, we show that the observability matrix is related to the map between the original phase space and the differential embedding induced by the observable.

Differential models are, in general, very complicated and do not necessarily capture all properties of the original dynamics.

Rather than deriving such a model, which requiring prior knowledge about the dynamics, a 3D model is here obtained by using a global vector field reconstruction technique starting from the measured time dependence of [CeIV].

Systematic template extraction from chaotic attractors: I. Genus-one attractors with an inversion symmetry,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,"Describing the topological properties by a template is a powerful technique to classify chaotic attractors. Most of the time, reduced templates are used, but direct templates—in which all mechanisms (torsions, branch permutation, etc) identified in the attractor are explicitly described without any simplification—are of great interest for a better description of the subtleties of the dynamics. We introduce here two additional conventions for representing in a unique way the reduced template from a given linking matrix. We then propose an addition law for linking matrices which allows us to manipulate (combine) different mechanisms. A direct template can thus be described by using a series of linking matrices.

Asynchrony and cyclic variability in pressure support noninvasive ventilation,Computers in biology and medicine,Noninvasive mechanical ventilation is an effective procedure to manage patients with acute or chronic respiratory failure. Most ventilators act as flow generators that assist spontaneous respiratory cycles by delivering inspiratory and expiratory pressures. This allows the patient to improve alveolar ventilation and subsequent pulmonary gas exchanges. The interaction between the patient and his ventilator are therefore crucial for tolerance and acceptability and part of this interaction is the facility to trigger the ventilator at the beginning of the inspiration. This is directly related to patients’ discomfort which is not quantified today. Phase portraits reconstructed from the airflow and first-return maps built on the total breath duration were used to investigate the quality of the patient–ventilator interaction. Phase synchronization can be identified from phase portrait and the breath-to-breath variability is well characterized by …,"00104825, 18790534",8.403
A symbolic network-based nonlinear theory for dynamical systems observability,Scientific reports,"When the state of the whole reaction network can be inferred by just measuring the dynamics of a limited set of nodes the system is said to be fully observable. However, as the number of all possible combinations of measured variables and time derivatives spanning the reconstructed state of the system exponentially increases with its dimension, the observability becomes a computationally prohibitive task. Our approach consists in computing the observability coefficients from a symbolic Jacobian matrix whose elements encode the linear, nonlinear polynomial or rational nature of the interaction among the variables. The novelty we introduce in this paper, required for treating large-dimensional systems, is to identify from the symbolic Jacobian matrix the minimal set of variables (together with their time derivatives) candidate to be measured for completing the state space reconstruction. Then symbolic observability …",20452322,3.883
A chemotherapy combined with an anti-angiogenic drug applied to a cancer model including angiogenesis,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","Combined therapy made of a chemotherapy and antiangiogenic agents is a clinical treatment recommended for its efficiency. Since the optimization of a treatment against cancer relasp is still mostly based on oncologist’s know-how, it is desirable to develop different approaches for such a task. Mathematical modelling is one of the promising ways. We here investigated the action of a combined therapy inserted to a mathematical cancer model in order to determine how the dynamics underlying tumor growth is governed by some key parameters. We here retained a chemotherapy (for instance, paclitaxel and carboplatin) combined with an antiangiogenic drug (as bevacizumab) applied to a cancer model describing the interactions between host, immune, tumor and endothelial cells. The effects of such a therapy are investigated and the relevant role played by the “normal” tissue of the tumor micro-environment is …",09600779,5.969
Semi-physical mean-value NOx model for diesel engine control,Control Engineering Practice,"A semi-physical model has been developed to predict nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions produced by diesel engines. This model is suitable for online NOx estimation and for model-based engine control. It is derived from a zero-dimensional thermodynamic model which was simplified by only retaining main phenomena contributing to NOx formation. The crank angle evolution of the burned gas temperature, which has a strong impact on NOx formation rate, is described by a semi-empirical model whose key variable is the maximum burned gas temperature. This variable presents a good correlation with the molar fraction of NOx at the end of combustion and can be expressed as a function of the intake burned gas ratio and the start of combustion. The maximum burned gas temperature sub-model is then coupled to an averaged NOx formation kinetic model (based on the Zeldovich mechanism) to form a mean-value …",09670661,6.287

Use of the nonlinear dynamical system theory to study cycle-to-cycle variations from spark ignition engine pressure data,SAE Technical papers,"Cycle-to-cycle variations in the pressure evolution within the cylinder of a spark ignition engine has long been recognized as a phenomenon of considerable importance. In this work, use of tools borrowed to the nonlinear dynamical system theory to investigate the time evolution of the cylinder pressure is explored. By computing a divergence rate between different pressure cycles versus crank angle, four phases during the combustion cycle are exhibited. These four phases may be identified with the four common phases evidenced by burn rate calculations [1]. Starting from phase portraits and using Poincaré sections, we also study correlations between peak pressures, IMEP and the durations from ignition to appearance of a flame kernel. Accounting for the fact that, during the ignition phase of the combustion cycle, trajectories in a plane projection of the reconstructed phase portrait associated with cycles in the case of motored engine cannot be distinguished from trajectories corresponding to combustion cycles, we estimate the duration of the ignition phase without any prior assumption on the combustion processes. Fluctuations of ignition phase lengths have been found to be correlated with IMEP standard deviations.","01487191, 26883627",0.549
Randomized trial comparing a web-mediated follow-up via patient-reported outcomes (PRO) vs. routine surveillance in lung cancer patients: final results.,Journal of Clinical Oncology,"6500
Background: In a previous interim analysis, we found a 7-month median overall survival (OS) benefit (p = 0.002) associated with web-based monitoring to detect recurrence in lung cancer patients after initial treatment, vs. scheduled imaging. We hypothesized that benefit was due to earlier detection of symptoms and relapses, prompting earlier treatment and supportive care. Final results with 2-year follow-up is presented. Methods: Advanced-stage lung cancer patients without evidence of disease progression after initial treatment were randomly assigned to compare a web-mediated follow-up (experimental arm) based on weekly self-scoring of 13 common patient symptoms with a routine follow-up (control arm) with 3-6 months repeated CT-scans. In the experimental arm, an alert email was sent to the oncologist when self-scored symptoms matched predefined criteria. The IRB protocol-specified primary …","0732183X, 15277755",13.642
A cancer model for the angiogenic switch,Journal of theoretical biology,"The occurrence of metastasis is an important feature in cancer development. In order to have a one-site model taking into account the interactions between host, effector immune and tumor cells which is not only valid for the early stages of tumor growth, we developed in this paper a new model where are incorporated interactions of these three cell populations with endothelial cells. These latter cells are responsible for the neo-vascularization of the tumor site which allows the migration of tumor cells to distant sites. It is then shown that, for some parameter values, the resulting model for the four cell populations reproduces the angiogenic switch, that is, the transition from avascular to vascular tumor.","00225193, 10958541",1.985
Dynamical analysis of an intermittency in an open cavity flow,Physics of Fluids,"When open flows pass an open cavity, it is known that for medium or large Reynolds numbers, self-sustained oscillations generally appear. When more than one mode is excited, some nonlinear competition between modes may occur. In the configuration investigated here, the underlying dynamics are mainly driven by two dominant modes. The interplay between these two modes is investigated using phase portraits, Poincaré sections, and return maps. The toroidal structure of the phase portrait is then investigated using a symbolic dynamics built from an angular return map. Each symbol can be associated with a specific mode and the interplay described in terms of symbolic sequences, leading to exhibit a switching mode process.","10706631, 10897666",4.107
Dynamical analysis of fractional-order Rössler and modified Lorenz systems,Physics Letters A,"This Letter is devoted to the dynamical analysis of fractional-order systems, namely the Rössler and a modified Lorenz system. The work here described compares the dynamical regimes of such fractional-order systems to that of the corresponding standard systems. It turns out that most of the chaotic attractors are topologically equivalent to those found in the original integer-order systems, although in some particular (and apparently rare) cases unusual bifurcation patterns and attractors are found.","00036951, 10773118",3.462
Connecting curves for dynamical systems,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,"We introduce one-dimensional sets to help describe and constrain the integral curves of an n-dimensional dynamical system. These curves provide more information about the system than zero-dimensional sets (fixed points). In fact, these curves pass through the fixed points. Connecting curves are introduced using two different but equivalent definitions, one from dynamical systems theory, the other from differential geometry. We describe how to compute these curves and illustrate their properties by showing the connecting curves for a number of dynamical systems.","17518113, 17518121",2.078
Analysis of a nonsynchronized sinusoidally driven dynamical system,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"A nonautonomous system, i.e. a system driven by an external force, is usually considered as being phase synchronized with this force. In such a case, the dynamical behavior is conveniently studied in an extended phase space which is the product of the phase space ℝm of the undriven system by an extra dimension associated with the external force. The analysis is then performed by taking advantage of the known period of the external force to define a Poincaré section relying on a stroboscopic sampling. Nevertheless, it may so happen that the phase synchronization does not occur. It is then more convenient to consider the nonautonomous system as an autonomous system incorporating the subsystem generating the driving force. In the case of a sinusoidal driving force, the phase space is ℝm+2 instead of the usual extended phase space ℝm × S1. It is also demonstrated that a global model may then be …","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Experimental evidence for a torus breakdown in a glow discharge plasma,Physical Review E,"A global bifurcation scenario for a two-frequency torus breakdown depicted by Baptista and Caldas [Physica D 132, 325 (1999)] is observed on a glow-discharge experiment. The torus is broken through a crisis with an unstable periodic orbit. The torus section before the bifurcation is a sided polygon that has a number of edges equal to the period of the unstable orbit. Since the discharge is an extended system the two-frequency torus breakdown is shown to be a possible way to space-time chaos.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Reconstructing a dynamics from a scalar time series,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,"Chaotic time series data are now commonly observed in a large variety of fields. The analysis of such time series and the extraction of physical information is therefore a topic of growing interest. The techniques have matured to the point where they have become of practical use. It is the purpose of this review to discuss some such applications. For excellent general recent reviews of the available techniques we refer the reader to references 1 and 2.
This type of analysis presumes that the data have been generated by a low dimensional physical dynamics of a priori unknown nature, and that the signal may have been contaminated by noise of various sorts. In most applications we have at our disposal only a single measured quantity, ie, a scalar time series. Fortunately one can exploit a very powerful redundancy principle that is discussed in the pioneering papers by Packard et aL3 and by Takens4 (cf. also reference 5) which allow one to reconstruct an image of the whole dynamics in an embedding space. These embedding theorems allow one then to extract useful information about the unknown dynamics from this single measured variable. The first step in the analysis then consists of a phase-space reconstruction in an embedding space. In order to achieve it, we have to determine the embedding dimension d, of the reconstructed phase space (also called state space). Of particular interest is of course the minimum embedding dimension, ie, the lowest dimension for which the reconstruction gives an unambiguous image of the attractor. The reconstruction may be carried out in a number of ways, but it is safest to use several techniques because …","00778923, 17496632",4.774
Generalized optical theorem for on-axis Gaussian beams,Optics communications,"The optical theorem for an incident plane wave interacting with a finite scatterer is generalized to the case of on-axis Gaussian beams, taken as examples of shaped beams. Our results are restricted in this paper to homogeneous spheres. The beams are defined by using (i) the standard description (ii) the localized approximation and (iii) the modified localized approximation. Rigorous expressions generalizing the classical plane wave case expression are given and numerically discussed. A recently proposed approximation is investigated in order to point out assumptions underlying its validity.",00304018,2.447
Nonlinear graph-based theory for dynamical network observability,Physical Review E,"A faithful description of the state of a complex dynamical network would require, in principle, the measurement of all its variables, an infeasible task for high dimensional systems due to practical limitations. However the network dynamics might be observable from a reduced set of measured variables but how to reliably identify the minimum set of variables providing full observability still remains an unsolved problem. In order to tackle this issue from the Jacobian matrix of the governing equations, we construct a pruned fluence graph in which the nodes are the state variables and the links represent only the linear dynamical interdependences after having ignored the nonlinear ones. From this graph, we identify the largest connected subgraphs with no outgoing links in which every node can be reached from any other node in the subgraph. In each one of them, at least one node must be measured to correctly monitor the …","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Symbolic computations of nonlinear observability,Physical Review E,"Observability is a very useful concept for determining whether the dynamics of complicated systems can be correctly reconstructed from a single (univariate or multivariate) time series. When the governing equations of dynamical systems are high-dimensional and/or rational, analytical computations of observability coefficients produce large polynomial functions with a number of terms that become exponentially large with the dimension and the nature of the system. In order to overcome this difficulty, we introduce here a symbolic observability coefficient based on a symbolic computation of the determinant of the observability matrix. The computation of such coefficients is straightforward and can be easily analytically carried out, as demonstrated in this paper for a five-dimensional rational system.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Systematic template extraction from chaotic attractors: II. Genus-one attractors with multiple unimodal folding mechanisms,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,"Asymmetric and symmetric chaotic attractors produced by the simplest jerk equivariant system are topologically characterized. In the case of this system with an inversion symmetry, it is shown that symmetric attractors bounded by genus-one tori are conveniently analyzed using a two-components Poincaré section. Resulting from a merging attractor crisis, these attractors can be easily described as being made of two folding mechanisms (here described as mixers), one for each of the two attractors co-existing before the crisis: symmetric attractors are thus described by a template made of two mixers. We thus developed a procedure for concatenating two mixers (here associated with unimodal maps) into a single one, allowing the description of a reduced template, that is, a template simplified under an isotopy. The so-obtained reduced template is associated with a description of symmetric attractors based on one …","17518113, 17518121",2.078
Intermittency and period-doubling cascade on tori in a bimode laser model,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","Dynamical regimes observed in a bipolarized neodymium-doped fibre laser self Q-switched by a thin slice of a polymer-based saturable absorber were recently reported [Martel G, Bennoud M, Ortac B, Chartier T, Nunzi J-M, Boudebs G, et al. Dynamics of a vectorial neodymium-doped fibre laser passively Q switched by a polymer-based saturable absorber. J Modern Opt 2004;51(1):85–95]. Among them, period-doubling cascade, chaotic and intermittent regimes have been identified but due to the shortness of the time series available, it was not possible to investigate them with the techniques of the nonlinear dynamical system theory. With the help of a rate-equation based bimode laser model, a period-doubling cascade on tori and intermittent behaviors with underlying torus-like structure are investigated.",09600779,5.969
Observability coefficients for predicting the class of synchronizability from the algebraic structure of the local oscillators,Physical Review E,"Understanding the conditions under which a collective dynamics emerges in a complex network is still an open problem. A useful approach is the master stability function—and its related classes of synchronization—which offers a necessary condition to assess when a network successfully synchronizes. Observability coefficients, on the other hand, quantify how well the original state space of a system can be observed given only the access to a measured variable. The question is therefore pertinent: Given a generic dynamical system (represented by a state variable ) and given a generic measure on it (which may be either an observation of an external agent, or an output function through which the units of a network interact), are classes of synchronization and observability actually related to each other? We explicitly address this issue, and show a series of nontrivial relationships for networks of different …","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Automatic sleep staging from ventilator signals in non-invasive ventilation,Computers in biology and medicine,"Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), a recognized treatment for chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, is predominantly applied at night. Nevertheless, the quality of sleep is rarely evaluated due to the required technological complexity. A new technique for automatic sleep staging is here proposed for patients treated by NIV. This new technique only requires signals (airflow and hemoglobin oxygen saturation) available in domiciliary ventilators plus a photo-plethysmogram, a signal already managed by some ventilators. Consequently, electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, electromyogram, and electrocardiogram recordings are not needed. Cardiorespiratory features are extracted from the three selected signals and used as input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) multi-class classifier. Two different types of sleep scoring were investigated: the first type was used to distinguish three stages (wake, REM sleep and …","00104825, 18790534",8.403
Poincaré sections for a new three-dimensional toroidal attractor,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,"A new 3D autonomous dynamical system proposed by Li (2008 Phys. Lett. A 372 387) produces a chaotic attractor whose global topological properties are unusual. The attractor has a rotation symmetry and only a single real fixed point for the parameters used in his study. The symmetric, complex pair of fixed points cannot be ignored: they play a major role in organizing the motion on a surface of peculiar toroidal type. We describe this attractor, propose a simple, intuitive model to understand it, show that it is of toroidal type and of genus three, construct a global Poincaré surface of section with two disjoint components and use this section to locate unstable periodic orbits and determine their topological period. We also show that its image attractor is of genus one and supports flow on a simple wrinkled torus. Finally, we use the interplay between the original covering attractor and its image as an aid to understand …","17518113, 17518121",2.078
Symbolic sequence analysis using approximated partition,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","A particular attention has been paid to characterizing the dynamical behavior using symbolic sequences when there is no topological criterion to define the partition. In that case, a so-called threshold crossings technique is used. It is shown that maximizing the number of realized sequences provides a partition closer to the topological partition than using a partition leading to equiprobable symbols. After numerical evidences on benchmark maps, an experimental time series from a copper electrodissolution is used to check the applicability of this technique.",09600779,5.969
Scalar modeling and analysis of a 3D biochemical reaction model,Journal of theoretical biology,"For many systems it is advantageous if analysis and modeling can be accomplished from a scalar time series because this greatly facilitates the experimental setup. Moreover, in real-life systems it is hardly true that all the state variables are available for analysis and modeling. Since the late 1980s, techniques have been put forward for building mathematical models from a scalar time series. One of the objectives of this paper is to verify if it is possible to obtain global non-linear models (non-linear differential equations) from scalar time series. Such data are obtained using a model of biochemical reaction with aperiodic (chaotic) oscillations as recently observed in the case of a glycolytic reaction (Nielsen, K., Sorensen, P.G., Hynne, F., 1997. Chaos in glycolysis. J Theor. Biol. 186, 303–306.). The main objective, however, is to investigate which state variable is more convenient for the task in practice.

Structure selection for global vector field reconstruction by using the identification of fixed points,Physical Review E,"Global vector field reconstruction is a well established technique to provide phenomenological models from nonlinear data, in particular when all information is contained in a so-called standard function. In the case when the standard function is taken as a ratio of polynomials, we establish that information about the fixed points of the system can be automatically retrieved from the data, allowing one to build a better model by selecting an appropriate structure. The method is exemplified in the case of the variable z of the Rössler system, which constitutes a rather acid test case.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Topological characterization of a system with high-order symmetries,Physical Review E,"Topological characterization of the Lorenz attractor taking into account the two-order equivariance of the vector field has been recently proposed by introducing a fundamental domain (typically a wing) and one copy of it. The present paper generalizes this approach to n-order equivariant systems. The general procedure is illustrated by taking a specific example, namely the so-called proto-Lorenz system which is derived from the Lorenz one. It is shown that symmetric attractors are tiled by n representations of a fundamental domain and that fundamental linking numbers therefore have to be introduced to conveniently validate the template.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Global modeling of aggregated and associated chaotic dynamics,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","Spatially distributed systems are rather difficult to investigate due to two distinct problems which can be sometimes combined. First, the spatial extension is taken into account by monitoring the system evolution at different locations. Second, the dynamics cannot always be continuously tracked in time, and segments of data – sometimes recorded at different places – are only available. When the dynamics underlying a single marker is under consideration – as for instance the normalized difference vegetation index which can be used for assessing the vegetation canopy of a given area – a global model can be obtained from a single scalar time series built by aggregating the available time series recorded at different places and/or associating the segments of data recorded at different times (and possibly at different locations). We investigated how these two data preprocessing – common in environmental studies …",09600779,5.969
Chaos theory: a fascinating concept for oncologists,Cancer Radiotherapie: Journal de la Societe Francaise de Radiotherapie Oncologique,"The oncologist is confronted daily by questions related to the fact that any patient presents a specific evolution for his cancer: he is challenged by very different, unexpected and often unpredictable outcomes, in some of his patients. The mathematical approach used today to describe this evolution has recourse to statistics and probability laws: such an approach does not ultimately apply to one particular patient, but to a given more or less heterogeneous population. This approach therefore poorly characterizes the dynamics of this disease and does not allow to state whether a patient is cured, to predict if he will relapse and when this could occur, and in what form, nor to predict the response to treatment and, in particular, to radiation therapy. Chaos theory, not well known by oncologists, could allow a better understanding of these issues. Developed to investigate complex systems producing behaviours that cannot be predicted due to a great sensitivity to initial conditions, chaos theory is rich of suitable concepts for a new approach of cancer dynamics. This article is three-fold: to provide a brief introduction to chaos theory, to clarify the main connecting points between chaos and carcinogenesis and to point out few promising research perspectives, especially in radiotherapy.","12783218, 17696658",1.535
Influences on Otto E. Rössler's earliest paper on chaos,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Otto E. Rössler is well-known in ""chaos theory"" for having published one of the most often used benchmark systems producing chaotic attractors. His contribution is mostly reduced to this simple chaotic system published in 1976. Our aim is to show that a slightly earlier paper contains, in fact, much more and reveals a deep topological understanding of how chaotic attractors are organized in phase space. Moreover it is shown that Otto had three main influences: Andronov, Khaikin and Vitt's textbook, the 1963 Lorenz paper and Li and Yorke's theorem ""period-three implies chaos"". In this paper, these three contributions are clearly identified as the main influences on Rössler's earliest paper on chaos.

Controllability and synchronizability: Are they related?,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","In the two last decades the concept of observability has been formally linked to that of embedding in the context of nonlinear dynamics. Such a concept has been shown to play an important role in global modeling, data analysis and filtering, to mention a few examples. Preliminary results suggested that observability, at least in some cases, has some influence in synchronization problems. Could the dual concept of controllability also be important in such problems? In the context of synchronization, in general, the role played by controllability properties may not be as relevant as observability is for data analysis. In this work we compute controllability coefficients analogous to the observability ones, now established in the literature, and evaluate their importance in synchronization problems.

Complex intermittent dynamics in large-aspect-ratio homogeneously broadened single-mode lasers,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Spatio-temporal dynamics of a homogeneously broadened single-mode laser with large Fresnel number is investigated above the second laser threshold. The system is described by the two-level Maxwell–Bloch equations. A simple quasi-periodic regime is observed when the cavity is tuned below resonance, and very uncommon dynamics is obtained when the cavity is tuned above resonance. In the latter case, the laser intensity presents “plateaux” of nearly constant values which are interrupted by bursts of large amplitude oscillations. The underlying dynamics is described in terms of heteroclinic connections between unstable periodic orbits associated with constant intensities. A very surprising characteristic of this dynamics is that the periodic orbits are always visited in a given order which is related to the sequence of wave vectors selected by the laser.

Induced one-parameter bifurcations in identified nonlinear dynamical models,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"It is shown that nonlinear global models identified from a single time series can be used to reproduce the same sequence of bifurcations of the original system. This has been observed for simulated and real data and for both difference equation and differential equation models, thus suggesting some generality. The results reported in this paper are of a practical character and seem to have some bearing not only on the important subject of estimating bifurcation diagrams from data, but also in model validation problems since some models can reproduce the bifurcation sequence of a system even when such models do not settle to the original attractor at first. In this case, models which would be dismissed are shown to display consistent dynamic information about the original system, as illustrated by a simulated and a real data example.

Dressed symbolic dynamics,Physical Review E,"A strange attractor (SA) with symmetry group G can be mapped down to an image strange attractor SA without symmetry by a smooth mapping with singularities.

The covers are distinguished by an index. The index is an assignment of a group operator to each symbol σ i: σ i→ g α i. The subgroup H⊂ G generated by the group operators g α i in the index determines how many disconnected components (| G|/| H|) each equivariant cover has.

Radiotherapy and chaos theory: the tit bird and the butterfly...,Cancer Radiotherapie: Journal de la Societe Francaise de Radiotherapie Oncologique,"Although the same simple laws govern cancer outcome (cell division repeated again and again), each tumour has a different outcome before as well as after irradiation therapy. The linear-quadratic radiosensitivity model allows an assessment of tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy. This model presents some limitations in clinical practice because it does not take into account the interactions between tumour cells and non-tumoral bystander cells (such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells...) that modulate radiosensitivity and tumor growth dynamics. These interactions can lead to non-linear and complex tumor growth which appears to be random but that is not since there is not so many tumors spontaneously regressing. In this paper we propose to develop a deterministic approach for tumour growth dynamics using chaos theory. Various characteristics of cancer dynamics and tumor radiosensitivity can be explained using mathematical models of competing cell species.","12783218, 17696658",1.535
Recurrence plots for dynamical analysis of non-invasive mechanical ventilation,"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","Quantifiers were introduced to convert recurrence plots into a statistical analysis of dynamical properties. It is shown that the Shannon entropy, if properly computed, increases as the chaotic regime is developed as expected. Recurrence plots and a new estimator for the Shannon entropy are then used to identify asynchronisms in non-invasive mechanical ventilation. It is thus shown that the phase coherence—easily identified using a Shannon entropy—is relevant in the quality of the mechanical ventilation. In particular, some patients with chronic respiratory diseases or healthy subjects can have a high rate of asynchronisms but a regular breathing rhythm.","1364503X, 14712962",4.253

Dynamical taxonomy: Some taxonomic ranks to systematically classify every chaotic attractor,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Characterizing accurately chaotic behaviors is not a trivial problem and must allow to determine the properties that two given chaotic invariant sets share or not. The underlying problem is the classification of chaotic regimes, and their labeling. Addressing these problems corresponds to the development of a dynamical taxonomy, exhibiting the key properties discriminating the variety of chaotic behaviors discussed in the abundant literature. Starting from the hierarchy of chaos initially proposed by one of us, we systematized the description of chaotic regimes observed in three- and four-dimensional spaces, which cover a large variety of known (and less known) examples of chaos. Starting with the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents as the first taxonomic ranks, we extended the description to higher ranks with some concepts inherited from topology (bounding torus, surface of section, first-return map, …).

The success of this ventilatory assistance is often linked with patient's tolerance that is known to be related to the quality of the synchronization between patient's spontaneous breathing cycles and ventilatory cycles delivered by the ventilator. Thirty-four sleep sessions (more than 5000 ventilatory cycles each) were automatically investigated using a specific algorithm processing airflow and pressure time series. Four groups of patients were defined according to the interplay between asynchrony events and leaks. Different mechanisms that depend on sleep stages were thus evidenced. A Shannon entropy was also proposed as a new sleep fragmentation quantification methodology.,"02181274, 17936551",2.088
Toward a general procedure for extracting templates from chaotic attractors bounded by high genus torus,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"The topological analysis of chaotic attractor by means of template is rather well established for simple attractors as solution to the Rössler system. Lorenz-like attractors are already slightly more complicated because they are bounded by a genus-3 bounding torus, implying the necessity to use a two-component Poincaré section. In this paper, we enriched the concept of linking matrix to correctly describe an algebraic template for an attractor with (g - 1) components of Poincaré section and whose bounding torus has g interior holes aligned. An example with g = 5 — a multispiral attractor — is explicitly treated.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Flow curvature manifolds for shaping chaotic attractors: I. Rössler-like systems,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,"Poincaré recognized that phase portraits are mainly structured around fixed points. Nevertheless, the knowledge of fixed points and their properties is not sufficient to determine the whole structure of chaotic attractors. In order to understand how chaotic attractors are shaped by singular sets of the differential equations governing the dynamics, flow curvature manifolds are computed. We show that the time-dependent components of such manifolds structure Rössler-like chaotic attractors and may explain some limitation in the development of chaotic regimes.","17518113, 17518121",2.078
Unimodal order in the image of the simplest equivariant chaotic system,Physical Review E,"The simplest equivariant chaotic dynamics is investigated in terms of its image, ie, under the 2→ 1 mapping allowing one to obtain a projection of the dynamics without any residual symmetry. The inversion symmetry is therefore deleted. The bifurcation diagram can thus be predicted from the unimodal order although the first-return map computed in the original phase space exhibits three critical points. This feature is the same as the one observed on the Burke and Shaw system although this latter system has a rotation symmetry.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Patient-ventilator synchronization during non-invasive ventilation: a pilot study of an automated analysis system,Frontiers in Medical Technology,"Background: Patient-ventilator synchronization during non-invasive ventilation (NIV) can be assessed by visual inspection of flow and pressure waveforms but it remains time consuming and there is a large inter-rater variability, even among expert physicians. SyncSmart™ software developed by Breas Medical (Mölnycke, Sweden) provides an automatic detection and scoring of patient-ventilator asynchrony to help physicians in their daily clinical practice. This study was designed to assess performance of the automatic scoring by the SyncSmart software using expert clinicians as a reference in patient with chronic respiratory failure receiving NIV.
Methods: From nine patients, 20 min data sets were analyzed automatically by SyncSmart software and reviewed by nine expert physicians who were asked to score auto-triggering (AT), double-triggering (DT), and ineffective efforts (IE). The study procedure was similar to the one commonly used for validating the automatic sleep scoring technique. For each patient, the asynchrony index was computed by automatic scoring and each expert, respectively. Considering successively each expert scoring as a reference, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), κ-coefficients, and agreement were calculated.
Results: The asynchrony index assessed by SynSmart was not significantly different from the one assessed by the experts (18.9 ± 17.7 vs. 12.8 ± 9.4, p = 0.19). When compared to an expert, the sensitivity and specificity provided by SyncSmart for DT, AT, and IE were significantly greater than those provided by an expert when compared to another expert.

Intermittency as a transition to turbulence in pipes: A long tradition from Reynolds to the 21st century,Comptes Rendus. Mécanique,"In the development of science, it often happens that a concept that has a long tradition in one scientific community is rediscovered by another one, being considered as fully new in its early phase. It also happens that a relevant result in a field has at the end a stronger impact in a different field. Such a situation arose with Les méthodes nouvelles de la mécanique céleste written by Henri Poincaré [1], which resulted from a technical problem encountered in celestial mechanics for more than one century (the small divisors problem, see [2] for details) and which lead to the birth of the nonlinear dynamical systems theory. Today, astronomers, as Michelle Chapront-Touzé in her lunar theory [3], refer to Charles Delaunay [4, 5], George William Hill [6] or Ernst Brown [7], and are thankful to Kepler, but not to Poincaré. Jacques Laskar read Laplace and Le Verrier but do not too much Poincaré’s contribution. For instance, in his researches on the stability of the solar system [8], Laskar refers a lot to Laplace [9–11] and Le Verrier [12] and only quotes Poincaré [1] for the lack of integrability of the three body problem and the existence of “chaotic” solutions. Contrary to this, Poincaré’s book was the starting point for “dynamicists” or “chaoticians” as George Birkhoff [13], Vladimir Arnold [14], or Edward Lorenz [15]. Based on a technical problem in celestial mechanics, Poincaré’s contribution was relevant for another field,“chaos theory”. In this paper, I will show that the transition to turbulence via intermittency follows more or less this example. First, there is a long tradition in investigating the route to turbulence, and intermittencies were already observed in the early …","16310721, 18737234",1.055

Analogy between a 10D model for nonlinear wave–wave interaction in a plasma and the 3D Lorenz dynamics,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"This paper investigates nonlinear wave–wave interactions in a system that describes a modified decay instability and consists of three Langmuir and one ion-sound waves. As a means to establish that the underlying dynamics exists in a 3D space and that it is of the Lorenz-type, both continuous and discrete-time multivariable global models were obtained from data. These data were obtained from a 10D dynamical system that describes the modified decay instability obtained from Zakharov’s equations which characterise Langmuir turbulence. This 10D model is equivariant under a continuous rotation symmetry and a discrete order-2 rotation symmetry. When the continuous rotation symmetry is modded out, that is, when the dynamics are represented with the continuous rotation symmetry removed under a local diffeomorphism, it is shown that a 3D system may describe the underlying dynamics.

Multichannel intermittencies induced by symmetries,Physical Review E,"Type-I intermittencies are common phenomena that are often observed in the neighborhood of periodic windows when a control parameter is varied. These intermittencies usually have a single reinjection channel, that is, a single type of laminar phase was observed. Recently, type-I intermittencies with two reinjection channels were reported in several systems. In this paper, it will be shown that type-I intermittencies with n channels of reinjection are associated with the coexistence of n stable periodic orbits that are mapped into each other under a symmetry. A procedure to build type-I intermittency with n reinjection channels using the n-fold cover of an image system is presented. Cases up to n= 3 are explicitly given with the covers of the centered Rössler system.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Topological analysis of chaos in a three-variable biochemical model,Acta biotheoretica,"A three-variable biochemical prototype involving two enzymes with autocatalytic regulation proposed by Decroly and Goldbeter (1987) is analyzed using a topological approach. A two-branched manifold, a so-called template, is thus identified. For certain control parameter values, this template is a horseshoe template with a global torsion of two half-turns. This implies that the bifurcation diagram can be described using the usual sequences associated with a unimodal map with a differentiable maximum as well as exemplified by the logistic map. Moreover, a type-I intermittency associated with a saddle-node bifurcation is exhibited. The dynamics from a single time series are also investigated to determine whether it is possible to investigate the dynamics of this biochemical model from the measure of a single concentration.","00015342, 15728358",1.75
Spatial avascular growth of tumor in a homogeneous environment,Journal of theoretical biology,"Describing tumor growth is a key issue in oncology for correctly understanding the underlying mechanisms leading to deleterious cancers. In order to take into account the micro-environment in tumor growth, we used a model describing — at the tissue level — the interactions between host (non malignant), effector immune and tumor cells to simulate the evolution of cancer. The spatial growth is described by a Laplacian operator for the diffusion of tumor cells. We investigated how the evolution of the tumor diameter is related to the dynamics (periodic or chaotic oscillations, stable singular points) underlying the interactions between the different populations of cells in proliferation sites. The sensitivity of this evolution to the key parameter responsible for the immuno-evasion, namely the growth rate of effector immune cells and their inhibition rate by tumor cells, is also investigated.","00225193, 10958541",1.985
Henri Poincaré and the principle of relativity,Contemporary Physics,"Often considered as the last ‘encyclopedist’, Henri Poincaré died one hundred years ago. If he was a prominent man in 1900 French Society, his heritage is not so clearly recognised, particularly in France. Among his too often misunderstood works is his contribution to the theory of relativity, mainly because it is almost never presented within Poincaré's general approach to science, including his philosophical writings. Our aim is therefore to provide an historical account of the main steps (experimental as well as theoretical) which led Poincaré to contribute to the theory of relativity. Starting from the optical experiments which led to the inconsistency of the classical (Galilean) composition law for velocities to explain light propagation, we introduce the FitzGerald and Lorentz contraction which was viewed as the ‘sole hypothesis’ to explain the Michelson and Morley experiment.

Modeling maps by using rational functions,Physical Review E,"Rational functions are not very useful for obtaining global differential models because they involve poles that may eject the trajectory to infinity. In contrast, it is here shown that they allow one to significantly improve the quality of models for maps. In such a case, the presence of poles does not involve any numerical difficulty when the models are iterated. The models then take advantage of the ability of rational functions to capture complicated structures that may be generated by maps.

Depending on the parameter values, the Hénon map is orientation preserving or reversing; it is here shown that while a tridimensional suspension can be obtained in the former case, a four-dimensional flow is required to suspend the latter. A topological characterization of the three-dimensional suspension proposed by Starrett and Nicholas for the orientation preserving area is performed. A template is proposed for the four-dimensional case, for which the governing equations remain to be obtained.","00036951, 10773118",3.462

Nonstandard discretization schemes applied to the conservative Hénon–Heiles system,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"The discretization of ordinary differential equations is investigated for the case of the conservative Hénon–Heiles system.

Leakage estimation using Kalman filtering in noninvasive mechanical ventilation,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,"Noninvasive mechanical ventilation is today often used to assist patient with chronic respiratory failure.

It is shown that the topology of chaotic solutions only depends on the parity of n, that is, on the symmetry properties and not on the degree of nonlinearity.

They showed that these long-lived mammalians present specific genes with evidence of transcriptional activity related to TP53 expression, to cell cycle and to DNA repair that may explain the very low lifespan cancer rate measured in these mammals [1, 2], a particularity which was selected during million years of evolution of these species. In another recent paper, Tomasetti et al. reported that variations in cancer risk among tissues can be correlated to the number of stem cell divisions during the average lifetime of humans, thus exhibiting the important role of aging since longer one lives, greater his cancer risk [3]. These two features are two puzzling aspects related to carcinogenesis which can be expressed as:","00074551, 17696917",0.773
Reconstruction‐based interval observer dedicated to fault detection: Application to a throttle valve,International Journal of Adaptive Control and Signal Processing,"Model‐based fault detection is a very wide field of research. Sometimes, uncertainties within the model create deviations affecting fault detection. Several methods have been developed in order to overcome this problem. In this paper, a very well‐suited observer for uncertain fault detection, called set‐valued observer is investigated. However, this observer needs all the sensors to work properly. Other works have focused on the well‐known Luenberger observer applied to uncertain systems, but this architecture has its own limitation. Indeed, the recursivity of the algorithm induces the wrapping effect. Here an approach coupling the Luenberger observer with the set‐valued observer is proposed in order to reconstruct the state sets without divergence. The proposed observer is implemented for the purpose of fault detection on a throttle valve. The nonlinearities of the uncertain system induce a loss of information and …","08906327, 10991115",4.221
Théorie du chaos en radiothérapie: la mésange et le papillon…,Cancer/Radiothérapie,"Alors que tous les cancers obéissent a priori aux mêmes lois simples (une cellule qui se divise à l’infini), aucune tumeur n’a la même évolution, que ce soit avant ou après radiothérapie. Le modèle linéaire-quadratique se présente comme la probabilité qu’a une tumeur donnée à être sensible à une telle thérapie. Ce modèle a évidemment des limites que l’on retrouve dans un certain nombre de situations pratiques, car il n’évalue pas les interactions des cellules tumorales avec les cellules du voisinage (endothéliales, les fibroblastes, les cellules immunitaires…) qui ont pourtant un rôle majeur sur la radiosensibilité et la dynamique globale de la tumeur.

Objective evaluation of patient–ventilator interactions during noninvasive ventilation (NIV),European Respiratory Review,"The success of NIV depends on patient–ventilator interactions. These interactions are evaluated with the subjective comfort score which is not always reliable. An objective evaluation is thus required. To evaluate these interactions, we use a statistical measure of the variability of a physiological signal, i.e the Shannon entropy. Our purpose is to show whether estimating Shannon entropy from airway pressure (SP) and from the total duration of ventilatory cycles (ST) may evaluate objectively the patient–ventilator interactions during NIV.
Pressure support NIV was applied to 4 COPD patients, 4 OHS patients in stable state and 4 healthy subjects during six successive 10-min periods with various inspiratory pressure. The flow and the airway pressure signals were recorded with sensors located near the mask.

Reconstruction of a set of differential equations modelling an experimental homoclinic chaos in the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction,AIP Conference Proceedings,"We analyze chemical experimental time series by means of recent tools from nonlinear dynamics. More specifically, experiments on the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction [1] in a continuous flow reactor reveal a spiralling strange attractor which arises from a (global) homoclinic bifurcation. By using a global vector field reconstruction method, a set of ordinary differential equations is obtained from the measurements of the time dependence of [CeIV]. We show that a tridimensional space is sufficient to embed the behavior of the BZ reaction as suggested by previous works and that the reconstructed model allows us to exhibit topological properties which are not clearly evidenced from the experimental data. We investigate topological properties from the reconstructed set of ODEs and compare them with properties of the phase portrait directly reconstructed from the data and of the phase portrait associated with a 3D model …","0094243X, 15517616",13516.0
Assessing synchronizability provided by coupling variable from the algebraic structure of dynamical systems,Physical Review E,"Synchronization is a very generic phenomenon which can be encountered in a large variety of coupled dynamical systems. Being able to synchronize chaotic systems is strongly dependent on the nature of their coupling. Few attempts to explain such a dependency using observability and/or controllability were not fully satisfactory and synchronizability yet remained unexplained. Synchronizability can be defined as the range of coupling parameter values for which two nearly identical systems are fully synchronized. Our objective is here to investigate whether synchronizability can be related to the main rotation necessarily required for structuring any type of attractor, that is, whether synchronizability is significantly improved when the coupling variable is one of the variables involved in the main rotation. We thus propose a semianalytic procedure from a single isolated system to discard the worst variable for fully …","24700045, 24700053",2.266

Conséquences des asynchronismes patient-ventilateur sur le sommeil au cours de la ventilation non invasive,Revue des Maladies Respiratoires,"Introduction
La ventilation non invasive (VNI) corrige l’insuffisance respiratoire chronique en délivrant une aide inspiratoire la plus synchronisée possible aux efforts inspiratoires du patient.

An Equivariant 3D model for the long‐term behavior of the solar activity,AIP Conference Proceedings,"Modeling dynamics underlying the sunspot numbers is an important problem because such data indicate the relative activity of the Sun. A key point in modeling sunspot data, which follows an 11‐year cycle, is the need to take into account the reversal of the Sun’s magnetic field, which follows a 22‐year cycle. This can be done using an appropriate coordinate transformation applied to the phase portrait reconstructed from the sunspot numbers. Such a transformation introduces symmetry in the phase portrait and has the advantage of unfolding the structure of the dynamics. Global models have been obtained from such data. It is shown that the models capture the basic dynamical structure underlying the data which appears to be the structure of a Rössler attractor with an additional half twist.","0094243X, 15517616",13516.0
"Quasi-periodic behaviour in a model for the lithium-induced, electrical oscillations of frog skin",Comptes rendus. Biologies,"The fact that oscillations can be induced in studies of the maintenance of the electrical potential of frog skin by addition of lithium allowed evaluation of several parameters fundamental to the functioning of the system in vivo (eg relative volumes of internal compartments, characteristic times of ionic exchanges between compartments). A realistic model was thus proposed under the form of a set of ordinary differential equations. In the past, numerical simulations using such a model reproduced the periodic experimental oscillations and was able to provide an explanation for the global synchronised oscillations of the whole skin. In that paper, new numerical simulations reproduce the non-periodic oscillations which were observed two decades ago, but not reproduced by the model. Moreover, the dynamical process under which all the local oscillators are synchronised is explained in terms of a tangent bifurcation.
Le fait que des oscillations puissent être induites dans l’étude du maintien du potentiel électrique de peaux de grenouilles par ajout de lithium a permis l’évaluation de plusieurs paramètres fondamentaux liés au fonctionnement du système in vivo (par exemple, les volumes relatifs des compartiments internes, les temps caractéristiques des échanges ioniques entre compartiments). Un modèle réaliste fut ainsi proposé sous la forme d’un système d’équations différentielles ordinaires.

Phase intermittency in jet atomization processes,AIP Conference Proceedings,"The dynamics governing the atomization processes for excited and free cylindrical liquid jets are here investigated by recording the time evolution of the jet diameter by using a laser extinction technique for successive locations along the jet axis. State portraits are hereafter reconstructed by using the delay coordinates. When the jet is forced at a frequency close to the Rayleigh frequency, a first-return map to a Poincaré section clearly reveals a phase intermittency for a time evolution of the diameter recorded near the break-up in droplets. Such a behavior is also observed for free jets although the dynamics is slightly diffused by stochastic perturbations. The deterministic behavior is also exhibited by using a statistical symbolic dynamics.","0094243X, 15517616",13516.0
Numerical interpretation of controllability coefficients in nonlinear dynamics,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"As its dual, observability, the controllability of controllable systems actuated in different ways can be quantified by coefficients which can be computed either by a numerical approach or a symbolic one. If the interpretation of observability coefficients is rather straightforward, this is not the case for controllability. This paper, after proposing slight but important adjustments to the computation of numerical controllability coefficients puts forward a numerical framework that can be used to provide some clue as how to interpret the role played by numerical and symbolical controllability coefficients. Using four different chaotic systems, it is showed how controllability may depend on the derivative to which the control law is applied and how this may be related to the corresponding coefficients. In practice could help to decide where to place actuators. The developed framework has two backbones: the power needed to achieve …",10075704,3.864
Physical Activity Program for the Survival of Elderly Patients With Lymphoma: Study Protocol for Randomized Phase 3 Trial,JMIR Research Protocols,"Background
The practice of regular physical activity can reduce the incidence of certain cancers (colon, breast, and prostate) and improve overall survival after treatment by reducing fatigue and the risk of relapse. This impact on survival has only been demonstrated in active patients with lymphoma before and after treatment. As poor general health status reduces the chances of survival and these patients are most likely to also have sarcopenia, it is important to be able to improve their physical function through adapted physical activity (APA) as part of supportive care management. Unfortunately, APA is often saved for patients with advanced blood cancer. As a result, there is a lack of data regarding the impact of standardized regular practice of APA and concomitant chemotherapy as first-line treatment on lymphoma survival.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the impact of a new and open rehabilitation program suitable for a frail population of patients treated for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

"Published in Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 83 (2016) 242–251","Chaos, Solitons and Fractals","In the two last decades the concept of observability has been formally linked to that of embedding in the context of nonlinear dynamics. Such a concept has been shown to play an important role in global modelling, data analysis and filtering, to mention a few examples. Preliminary results suggested that observability, at least in some cases, has some influence in synchronization problems. Could the dual concept of controllability also be important in such problems? In the context of synchronization, in general, the role played by controllability properties may not be as relevant as observability is for data analysis. In this work we compute controllability coefficients analogous to the observability ones, now established in the literature, and evaluate their importance in synchronization problems. Two benchmarks have been used in the simulations: the Rössler and the cord systems. The following schemes were investigated: synchronization to external sinusoidal force, complete replacement, uni-and bi-directional coupling of identical oscillators. The results discussed in this work show that controllability and synchronizability are not related in general.",09600779,5.969
A genesis of special relativity,International Journal of Modern Physics D,"The genesis of special relativity is intimately related to the development of the theory of light propagation. When optical phenomena were described, there are typically two kinds of theories: (i) One based on light rays and light particles and (ii) one considering the light as waves. When diffraction and refraction were experimentally discovered, light propagation became more often described in terms of waves. Nevertheless, when attempts were made to explain how light was propagated, it was nearly always in terms of a corpuscular theory combined with an ether, a subtle medium supporting the waves. Consequently, most of the theories from Newton's to those developed in the 19th century were dual and required the existence of an ether. We therefore used the ether as our Ariadne thread for explaining how the principle of relativity became generalized to the so-called Maxwell equations around the 1900's.

Ventilators are tested in standardized working conditions, answering to 3 patho-physiological models.

The results are synthetized in colored maps where each color represents the ventilator (in)ability to synchronize with a given inspiratory effort, that is, specified asynchrony events.

Modeling spatial tumor growth as seen in clinical and radiological observations,Cancer Research,"Aim:
Predicting tumour growth is a key issue in oncology for which correctly understanding underlying mechanisms is required. In order to do that, we developed a spatio-temporal mathematical model at tissue level for tumorigenesis.

This model is spontaneously able to reproduce angiogenic switch and metastatic phenotype.
Method:
The present work is devoted to an extension onto a spatial two-dimensional Euclidean grid in which each site corresponds to approximatively ten thousand square micrometers and contains about one hundred cells. Only tumour cells can diffuse from one site to one of its eight nearest neighbors, thus corresponding to a partial differential equation with an isotropic Laplacian operator for tumour cell diffusion …","00085472, 15387445",8.084

L’absence de données expérimentales chez l’animal non contraint est responsable en partie de ce manque de standardisation. Le but de ce travail a été de mettre au point un modèle expérimental simple pour analyser la déglutition sur une longue période de temps chez un animal sain et non contraint.

Poincaré section analysis of an experimental frequency intermittency in an open cavity flow,22nd International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics,"Open flows over a cavity present, even at medium Reynolds number, sustained oscillations resulting from a complex feedback process [1]. Previous works have reveals a mode-switching phenomenon which remains to characterize from a dynamical point of view. In the configuration here investigated, the intermittency between the two dominant modes is characterized using a symbolic dynamics based approach. The first step of the procedure is to reconstruct the phase space from the time series measured by the Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) technique, using the principal components. We show that the quite high dimensionality of the reconstructed space (d < 10), can be overcome by using a Poincaré section of the 2D projection of the phase portrait. The key step consists of a partition of the Poincaré section (the set of intersections of the trajectory in the reconstructed phase space with a transverse plane). The two modes are thus label led 0 and 1, respectively. The partition is based on an angular map, itself based on a first-return map to the Poincaré section. This partition allows, without any arbitrary thresholding (as spectral based modes separation method needs), a very precise quantification of all oscillating events.",-,153.0
093 Interface graphique pour l’étude des interactions patient-ventilateur en ventilation non invasive,Revue des Maladies Respiratoires,"Méthodes
Nous avons mis au point un algorithme écrit en Fortran, fonctionnant sous Linux, qui permet de détecter les EII à partir des signaux de débit et de pression enregistrés au sein du circuit de ventilation [1]. Le principe de détection de ces asynchronismes a été validé à l’aide de la mesure de pression œsophagienne et a prouvé son excellente sensibilité et spécificité. Cet algorithme a été transféré sous LabVIEW afin de faciliter son utilisation et de disposer d’un logiciel ergonomique pour une utilisation au lit du patient. La validation de la fonctionnalité de l’interface graphique développée sous LABVIEW a été faite à l’aide d’un poumon test actif (ASL 5000, IngMar Medical), permettant de simuler le comportement respiratoire d’un patient adulte ou enfant présentant une dysfonction ventilatoire obstructive ou restrictive.

Comportements quasi-periodiques dans un modele des oscillations electriques induites par le lithium de peaux de grenouilles.,Comptes rendus-Biologies,"The fact that oscillations can be induced in studies of the maintenance of the electrical potential of frog skin by addition of lithium allowed evaluation of several parameters fundamental to the functioning of the system in vivo (e.g. relative volumes of internal compartments, characteristic times of ionic exchanges between compartments). A realistic model was thus proposed under the form of a set of ordinary differential equations. In the past, numerical simulations using such a model reproduced the periodic experimental oscillations and was able to provide an explanation for the global synchronised oscillations of the whole skin. In that paper, new numerical simulations reproduce the non-periodic oscillations which were observed two decades ago, but not reproduced by the model. Moreover, the dynamical process under which all the local oscillators are synchronised is explained in terms of a tangent bifurcation.","16310691, 17683238",0.586
Global vector field reconstruction for dynamical systems,AIP Conference Proceedings,"When a dynamical system is studied, one of the most interesting goals is to obtain a set of differential equations which provides a model of its behavior. Indeed, it has been pointed out that the knowledge of a global model which captures all the underlying dynamics provides a significant step in the understanding of physical processes. In the case of experiments, the aim is therefore to obtain a set of ordinary differential equations which generates a behavior equivalent to the experimental one starting from a scalar time series given for an observable. The method, the so-called global vector field reconstruction, is described as well as exemplified on experimental cases arising from chemistry, namely a copper electrodissolution and a Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction. Numerical examples for taking into account a control parameter or for modelling a driven system are also discussed.","0094243X, 15517616",13516.0

Abstract. The topology of chaotic attractors produced by tridimensional systems can be be synthetized by a template, also named a branched manifold. If getting such a template is quite common for attractors bounded by genus-1 tori, it is far more difficult to extract a template for attractors bounded by a genus-3 bounding torus as exemplified by the Lorenz system. We here propose a brief presentation of some developments of a “template theory” leading to generalize the construction of template for attractors bounded by genus-g bounding tori. The explicit case of a multispiral attractor bounded by a genus-5 torus is treated to evidence its principle.","15504131, 19327420",18.604
Optimal number of sites in artificial pelagic multisite fisheries,Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences,"We present a mathematical model of artificial pelagic multisite fisheries. The model is a stock–effort dynamical model of a fishery subdivided into artificial fishing sites such as fish-aggregating devices (FADs) or artificial habitats (AHs). The objective of the work is to investigate the effects of the number of sites on the global activity of the fishery. We consider a linear chain of fishing sites in which fish are harvested by fishing vessels and a free stock that is unattached to the sites and not exploited. Fish movements between the sites and the free stock, as well as vessel displacements between the sites, are assumed to take place at a faster time scale than the variation of the stock and the change of the fleet size. We take advantage of these two time scales to derive a reduced model governing the dynamics of the total fish stock and the total fishing effort. We show that there exists an optimal number of fishing sites that …","0706652X, 12057533",1.954

A bioeconomic model of a fishery with saturated catch and variable price: Stabilizing effect of marine reserves on fishery dynamics,Ecological Complexity,"In this paper, we study a mathematical bio-economic model of a fishery with varying price. The three dimensional model describes the time evolution of the resource, the fishing effort and the price. The model is original because it considers a nonlinear harvesting function assumed to depend upon stock size and fishing effort with a saturation effect with respect to the resource as well as a price equation depending on demand and supply which is in addition proportional to price. Assuming that the price varies at a fast time scale, we are able to use ”aggregation of variables methods” in order to reduce the model in a two dimensional model at a slow time scale. This aggregated (reduced) model is analyzed. Several numerical simulations of the model are performed to substantiate our analytical findings.

Individuals are divided into juvenile and adult classes, and demography is described by means of a density-dependent Leslie matrix. Adults compete to access resources; every time two adults meet, they choose either being aggressive (hawk) or non-aggressive (dove) to get the best pay-off. Individual encounters occur much more frequently than demographic events, what yields that the model takes the form of a two-timescale system. Approximate aggregation methods allow us to reduce the system while preserving at the same time crucial asymptotic information for the whole population.

Basic reproduction ratio for a fishery model in a patchy environment,Acta biotheoretica,"We present a dynamical model of a multi-site fishery. The fish stock is located on a discrete set of fish habitats where it is catched by the fishing fleet. We assume that fishes remain on fishing habitats while the fishing vessels can move at a fast time scale to visit the different fishing sites. We use the existence of two time scales to reduce the dimension of the model : we build an aggregated model considering the habitat fish densities and the total fishing effort. We explore a regulation procedure, which imposes an average residence time in patches. Several equilibria exist, a Fishery Free Equilibria (FFEs) as well as a Sustainable Fishery Equilibria (SFEs). We show that the dynamics depends on a threshold which is similar to a basic reproduction ratio for the fishery. When the basic reproduction ratio is less or equal to 1, one of the FFEs is globally asymptotically stable (GAS), otherwise one of the SFEs is GAS.","00015342, 15728358",1.75
Optimal placement of marine protected areas to avoid the extinction of the fish stock,Journal of Biological Systems,"In this paper, we propose to study a fishery model with variable price. We assume that the price evolves much faster than the rest of the system. Under certain assumptions, this makes it possible to consider the fishery system as a slow–fast system, on two time scales, and to study it with a reduced model of dimension two. Two main cases can occur. The first one which we called catastrophic equilibrium corresponds to over-exploitation leading to fish extinction and a booming price. The second case corresponds to a sustainable fishery equilibrium which is stable. The possible effects of the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), sites where fishing is prohibited, on the fish stock and fishery are evaluated.

Fish grow logistically on each patch and are caught. We assume that migrations between the two sites are fast relative to local growth and fishing. Taking advantage of the time scales, we use methods of aggregation of variables to obtain a reduced model governing the total biomass of the fish population at a slow time scale. We are looking for the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for the system of the two connected patches. We show that although the total equilibrium population may be greater than the sum of the carrying capacities on each isolated site, the total catch is always less than or equal to the sum of the catches on the isolated fishing sites. We then consider a prey–predator community of fish in the same environment. We assume that only the predator is caught and not its prey, growing logistically on each site. We …","03043800, 18727026",2.868
Nonlinear diffusion in multi-patch logistic model,Journal of Mathematical Biology,"We examine a multi-patch model of a population connected by nonlinear asymmetrical migration, where the population grows logistically on each patch. Utilizing the theory of cooperative differential systems, we prove the global stability of the model. In cases of perfect mixing, where migration rates approach infinity, the total population follows a logistic law with a carrying capacity that is distinct from the sum of carrying capacities and is influenced by migration terms. Furthermore, we establish conditions under which fragmentation and nonlinear asymmetrical migration can lead to a total equilibrium population that is either greater or smaller than the sum of carrying capacities. Finally, for the two-patch model, we classify the model parameter space to determine if nonlinear dispersal is beneficial or detrimental to the sum of two carrying capacities.","03036812, 14321416",2.145
Effect of Hawk-Dove Game on the Dynamics of Two Competing Species,Acta Biotheor,"Outcomes of interspecific competition, and especially the possibility of coexistence, have been extensively studied in theoretical ecology because of their implications in community assemblages. During the last decades, the influence of different time scales through the local/regional dynamics of animal communities has received an increasing attention. Nevertheless, different time scales involved in interspecific competition can result form other processes than spatial dynamics. Here, we envision and analyze a new theoretical framework that couples a game theory approach for competition with a demographic model. We take advantage of these two time scales to derive a reduced model governing the total densities of the two populations and we study how these two time scales interfere and influence outcomes of species competition. We find that a competition process occurring on a faster time scale than …","00015342, 15728358",1.75

As application, an extension of a stage-structured population with intra-individual behavioural variability is presented. Individuals can adopt three different tactics: hawk, dove and bully.

On a two-strain epidemic model involving delay equations,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,"We propose an epidemiological model for the interaction of either two viruses or viral strains with cross-immunity, where the individuals infected by the first virus cannot be infected by the second one, and without cross-immunity, where a secondary infection can occur. The model incorporates distributed recovery and death rates and consists of integro-differential equations governing the dynamics of susceptible, infectious, recovered, and dead compartments. Assuming that the recovery and death rates are uniformly distributed in time throughout the duration of the diseases, we can simplify the model to a conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. Another limiting case arises if the recovery and death rates are approximated by the delta-function, thereby resulting in a new point-wise delay model that incorporates two time delays corresponding to the durations of the diseases. We establish the positiveness of solutions for the distributed delay models and determine the basic reproduction number and an estimate for the final size of the epidemic for the delay model. According to the results of the numerical simulations, both strains can coexist in the population if the disease transmission rates for them are close to each other. If the difference between them is sufficiently large, then one of the strains dominates and eliminates the other one.","15471063, 15510018",2.404

Maximum sustainable yield for a fishery with variable price,Journal of Biological Systems,"We present a bioeconomic fishery model with variable price based on supply and demand. The model considers three variables: resource biomass, fishing effort, and market price. Rapid price changes classify the fishery system as a slow–fast system. Two main cases arise: catastrophic equilibrium (CE) with overexploitation and fish extinction, and a sustainable fishery equilibrium. We aim to determine conditions for maximum sustainable yield by optimizing cost per unit of fishing effort. Additionally, we explore conditions to prevent extinction and restore sustainable fishing. Marine protected areas (MPAs) can restore fish stocks by destabilizing the CE and maintaining a stable positive equilibrium. A model incorporating an MPA and fish movement is proposed, suggesting a small carrying capacity-to-surface area ratio in the fishing zone. Optimal total catch can be achieved by selecting the appropriate MPA surface area.","02183390, 17936470",1.562
A model of a fishery with fish storage and variable price involving delay equations,Mathematical Biosciences,"We propose a bio-economic model of a fishery describing the variations of the fish stock, the fishing effort and the price of the resource on the market supposed to depend on supply and demand. The originality of this model comes from taking into account the storage of part of the resource for a certain time before being put up for sale on the market. Taking into account the supposedly fast price dynamics compared to the other mechanisms involved and after integration of the stock equation, the system is reduced to a system of two delayed differential equations. The qualitative analysis of the model is carried out with the search for equilibrium points and the study of their stability.

A stage structured population model with mature individuals using hawk and dove tactics,ARIMA,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of conflicting tactics of resource acquisition on stage structured population dynamics. We present a population subdivided into two distinct stages (immature and mature). We assume that immature individual survival is densitydependent. We also assume that mature individuals acquire resources required to survive and reproduce by using two contrasted behavioral tactics (hawk versus dove). Mature individual survival thus is assumed to depend on the average cost of fights while individual fecundity depends on the average gain in the competition to access the resource. Our model includes two parts: a fast part that describes the encounters and fights involves a game dynamic model based upon the replicator equations, and a slow part that describes the long-term effects of conflicting tactics on the population dynamics. The existence of two time scales allows studying the complete system from a reduced one, which describes the dynamics of the total immature and mature densities at the slow time scale. The analysis of this reduced model shows that proportion of hawks in non-aggressive populations is expected to be larger than in aggressive populations. The maximum fitness (maximum of the total density) in a rich environment is smaller for larger costs.",00189820,0.0

The results show that there are two main scenarios, one is the depletion of fish stocks due to overfishing by fishermen, which is called a “catastrophic” equilibrium; and the other is a stable and sustainable fishery equilibrium.

Coupling of Bio-Reactors to Increase Maximum Sustainable Yield,Mathematics,"In the field of fisheries management, the objective is to obtain an optimal catch while maintaining the fishery resource at a sufficiently high level to avoid the extinction of the exploited species. In mathematical fishery models, the fishing effort that must be implemented to have a sustainable fishery with a maximum harvest rate in the long term is sought. This goal is called the “Maximum Sustainable Yield” (MSY). In the chemostat, the substrate can be seen as prey of which the predator is the product. MSY search is thus extended to the classical chemostat model with a Monod function. There exists a dilution rate that maximizes the product synthesis. The study is extended to the case of the gradostat with fast substrate and product exchanges between two coupled bioreactors. The existence of two time scales makes it possible to apply methods of aggregation of variables to derive a reduced model governing a few global variables describing the dynamics of the complete system at the slow time scale. The analysis of the mathematical aggregated model is performed. Existence of equilibria as well as local and global stability are studied. The overall product yield in the system of coupled bioreactors may be greater than the sum of the yields of the two uncoupled bioreactors, i.e., if they functioned without connection between them. The increase in product yield is all the more important as the distribution of the substrate and of the product is asymmetrical between the two coupled bioreactors. The model is applied to fish farming by considering the coupling of two breeding sites. Here again, the model makes it possible to find the fast fish exchanges that must …",22277390,2.617
PREDATOR–PREY DYNAMICS WITH SEASONAL WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS,Journal of Biological Systems,"Water level in rivers, lakes and reservoirs has great influence on the interactions between prey and predator fish. Indeed, the increase of the water volume hinders the capture of the prey by the predator. The same reasoning applies when there is a decrease in the volume of water, favoring the capture of the prey by the predator. In this paper, we consider a seasonally varying predator–prey model to study the influence of water-level variations on the interaction between two species of fishes in an artificial lake. A seasonal variation of the water-level is introduced in the predation rate taking into account two values, leading to a general switched system. Permanence, stability and existence of an invariant domain containing at least one periodic solution are established. Our theoretical results confirm the assumption that the water exerts a strong influence on the interaction between fishes.","02183390, 17936470",1.562

On Incidence-Dependent Management Strategies against an SEIRS Epidemic: Extinction of the Epidemic Using Allee Effect,Mathematics,"We developed a mathematical model to study the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the dynamics of an epidemic. The level of intervention was assessed as a fraction of the population being isolated and depended on the level of incidence of the epidemic in the population. We performed a mathematical analysis of the model and showed that, depending on the choice of the prevalence-dependent isolation function, it is possible to create new endemic equilibria and to change the stability of the disease-free equilibrium for which the epidemic vanishes. The model was then applied to the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several NPI management strategies were considered. In the case of an NPI intensity increasing with the level of infection, it is possible to avoid the initial epidemic peak of great amplitude that would have occurred without intervention and to stabilize the epidemic at a chosen and sufficiently low endemic level. In the case of an NPI intensity decreasing with the level of infection, the epidemic can be driven to extinction by generating an “Allee” effect: when the incidence is below a given level, the epidemic goes extinct whereas, above it, the epidemic will still be able take hold at a lower endemic level. Simulations illustrate that appropriate NPIs could make the COVID-19 vanish relatively fast.

On an upper bound for the spreading speed,Discrete & Continuous Dynamical Systems - B,"In this paper, we use the exponential transform to give a unified formal upper bound for the asymptotic rate of spread of a population propagating in a one dimensional habitat. We show through examples how this upper bound can be obtained directly for discrete and continuous time models. This upper bound has the form min s>0 ln(ρ(s))/s and coincides with the speeds of several models found in the literature. 1. Introduction. Under favourable biological conditions, a well or newly established population in a one dimensional continuous habitat (e.g. coastline [24], river [27], a preferred direction in a multidimensional space), can spread at left (in the region x ≤ 0), at right (in the region x ≥ 0) or in both directions causing direct and indirect effects on the ecosystem [44, 7, 10, 14]. One important measure quantifying this spread is the asymptotic speed of propagation of the expanding population in the environment, generally called the invasion speed when dealing with the spread of invasive species [13]. This asymptotic quantity has been studied for a large class of biological models like reaction-diffusion [9, 1, 4, 19, 35], integrodifferential [30, 28], integrodifference [18, 42] and discrete-time recursion [48, 25] equations. A mathematical formulation of the asymptotic speed of spread (in short, spreading speed) appeared in the work of Aronson and Weinberger [1] on the Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion equation under specific conditions. They showed that the solutions N (t, x) (population density at time t and position x) travel in a one dimensional habitat of carrying capacity unity with a spreading speed c * > 0 characterized by the behaviour of N (t, ξ + ct) for …","10780947, 15535231",1.244

Mathematical Bio-Economics 2.0 for Sustainable Fisheries,HAL,"Reconciling food security, economic development and biodiversity conservation in the face of global changes is a major challenge. The sustainable uses of marine biodiversity in the context of climate change, invasive species, water pollution and demographic growth is an example of this bio-economic challenge. There is a need for quantitative methods, models, scenarios and indicators to support policies addressing this challenge. Although bio-economic models for marine resources date back to the 1950s and are still used in fisheries management and policy design, they need major improvements, extensions and breakthroughs.

On the date of the epidemic peak,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,"Epidemiologists have used the timing of the peak of an epidemic to guide public health interventions.

In this study, we analyze the time needed for an epidemic to reach its peak by presenting a straightforward analytical expression. Utilizing two epidemiological models, the first is a generalized SEIR model with two classes of latent individuals, while the second incorporates a continuous age structure for latent infections. We confirm the conjecture that the peak occurs at approximately T∼(ln N)/λ, where N is the population size and λ is the largest eigenvalue of the linearized system in the first model or the unique positive root of the characteristic equation in the second model.

Dynamic tracking with model-based forecasting for the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","In this paper, a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model has been used to track the evolution of the spread of COVID-19 in four countries of interest. In particular, the epidemic model, that depends on some basic characteristics, has been applied to model the evolution of the disease in Italy, India, South Korea and Iran. The economic, social and health consequences of the spread of the virus have been cataclysmic.

Emergence of mixed mode oscillations in random networks of diverse excitable neurons: The role of neighbors and electrical coupling,Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience,"In this paper, we focus on the emergence of diverse neuronal oscillations arising in a mixed population of neurons with different excitability properties. These properties produce mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) characterized by the combination of large amplitudes and alternate subthreshold or small amplitude oscillations. Considering the biophysically plausible, Izhikevich neuron model, we demonstrate that various MMOs, including MMBOs (mixed mode bursting oscillations) and synchronized tonic spiking appear in a randomly connected network of neurons, where a fraction of them is in a quiescent (silent) state and the rest in self-oscillatory (firing) states. We show that MMOs and other patterns of neural activity depend on the number of oscillatory neighbors of quiescent nodes and on electrical coupling strengths. Our results are verified by constructing a reduced-order network model and supported by systematic bifurcation diagrams as well as for a small-world network. Our results suggest that, for weak couplings, MMOs appear due to the de-synchronization of a large number of quiescent neurons in the networks. The quiescent neurons together with the firing neurons produce high frequency oscillations and bursting activity. The overarching goal is to uncover a favorable network architecture and suitable parameter spaces where Izhikevich model neurons generate diverse responses ranging from MMOs to tonic spiking.",16625188,2.388

Our analytical findings, supported by the results of numerical experiments, suggest that an unstable diffusive system can be made stable by increasing diffusivity constant to a sufficiently large value. It is also observed that the solution of the system converges to its equilibrium faster in the case of two-dimensional diffusion in comparison to the one-dimensional diffusion.

Spatiotemporal dynamics in a spatial plankton system,Mathematical Modelling of Natural Phenomena,"In this paper, we investigate the complex dynamics of a spatial plankton-fish system with Holling type III functional responses. We have carried out the analytical study for both one and two dimensional system in details and found out a condition for diffusive instability of a locally stable equilibrium. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of processes of pattern formation that involves organism distribution and their interaction of spatially distributed population with local diffusion. The results of numerical simulations reveal that, on increasing the value of the fish predation rates, the sequences spots → spot-stripe mixtures → stripes → hole-stripe mixtures holes → wave pattern is observed. Our study shows that the spatially extended model system has not only more complex dynamic patterns in the space, but also has spiral waves.","09735348, 17606101",2.544

Dynamical Behaviors of Fuzzy SIR Epidemic Model,Proceedings of the Conference of the European Society for Fuzzy Logic and Technology,"In this paper, we propose and analyze a fuzzy SIR model with an asymptotic transmission rate. Specifically, the fuzziness is due to the consideration of the disease transmission rate, additional death due to disease and rate of recovery from infection as fuzzy sets. Further, a comparative study of the equilibrium points of the disease for the classical and fuzzy models are performed. We study the fuzzy basic reproduction number for groups of infected individuals with different virus loads and compare with a basic reproduction number for the classical model. Finally, a program based on the basic reproduction value of disease control is suggested and the numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the analytical results.",-,153.0
Dynamics of generalist predator in a stochastic environment: effect of delayed growth and prey refuge,Applied Mathematics and Computation,"In this paper, an attempt has been made to understand the dynamics of a prey–predator system with multiple time delays where the predator population is regarded as a generalist type. In this regard, we consider a modified Holling–Tanner prey–predator system where a constant time delay is incorporated in the logistic growth of the prey to represent a delayed density dependent feedback mechanism and the second time delay is considered to account for the length of the gestation period of the predator. Predator’s interference in prey–predator relationship provides better descriptions of predator’s feeding over a range of prey–predator abundances, so the predator’s functional response is considered to be Type II ratio-dependent and foraging efficiency of predator largely varies with the refuge strategy of prey population. In accordance with previous studies, it is observed that delay destabilizes the system, in …","00963003, 18735649",3.991

Dynamical complexity in some ecological models: effects of toxin production by phytoplankton,Nonlinear Analysis: Modelling and Control,"We investigate dynamical complexities in two types of chaotic tri-trophic aquatic food-chain model systems representing a real situation in the marine environment. Phytoplankton produce chemical substances known as toxins to reduce grazing pressure by zooplankton [1]. The role of toxin producing phytoplankton (TPP) on the chaotic behavior in these food chain systems is investigated. Holling type I, II, and III functional response forms are considered to study the interference between phytoplankton and zooplankton populations in the presence of toxic chemical. Our study shows that chaotic dynamics is robust to changes in the rates of toxin release as well as the toxin release functions. The present study also reveals that the rate of toxin production by toxin producing phytoplankton plays an important role in controlling oscillations in the plankton system. The different mortality functions of zooplankton due to toxin producing phytoplankton have significant influence in controlling oscillations, coexistence, survival or extinction of the zooplankton population. Further studies are needed to ascertain if this defence mechanism suppresses chaotic dynamics in model aquatic systems.","13925113, 23358963",2.832

These spatio-temporal patterns were obtained in computer simulations of a minimal model of phytoplankton–zooplankton dynamics driven by forces of diffusion. We also attempt to figure out the average lifetimes of these non-linear non-equilibrium patterns. These spatial patterns serve as a realistic model for patchiness found in aquatic systems (e.g., marine and oceanic). Additionally, spatio-temporal chaos produced by bi-directional WOCs is robust to changes in key parameters of the system; e.g., intra-specific competition among individuals of phytoplankton and the rate of fish predation.

Dynamical consequences of predator interference in a tri-trophic model food chain,Nonlinear analysis: Real world applications,A model food chain involving a specialist and a generalist predator is proposed and studied. One of the salient features of this model food chain is that it combines both the schemes (Volterra and Leslie) of modeling predator–prey interaction in one system in such a way that the demerits of these individual formulations are suppressed and the resulting model system represents a common unit of real world food webs. The stability analysis of the proposed model is carried out. The Hopf bifurcation conditions of the positive equilibrium point are established. Our numerical computations show that chaotic dynamics is sensitive to changes in values of parameters measuring attributes of either interacting populations or their environments. Two dimensional parameter scans suggest that the model food chain displays short-term recurrent chaos.

Predator interference effects on biological control: The “paradox” of the generalist predator revisited,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"An interesting conundrum in biological control questions the efficiency of generalist predators as biological control agents. Theory suggests, generalist predators are poor agents for biological control, primarily due to mutual interference. However field evidence shows they are actually quite effective in regulating pest densities. In this work we provide a plausible answer to this paradox. We analyze a three species model, where a generalist top predator is introduced into an ecosystem as a biological control, to check the population of a middle predator, that in turn is depredating on a prey species. We show that the inclusion of predator interference alone, can cause the solution of the top predator equation to blow-up in finite time, while there is global existence in the no interference case. This result shows that interference could actually cause a population explosion of the top predator, enabling it to control the target …",10075704,3.864

Dynamical complexities in a tri-trophic hybrid food chain model with Holling type II and Crowley–Martin functional responses,Nonlinear Analysis: Modelling and Control,"We study how predator behavior influences community dynamics of predatorprey systems. It turns out that predator behavior plays a dominant role in community dynamics. The hybrid model studied in this paper reveals that period-doubling and period-doubling reversals can generate short-term recurrent chaos (STRC), which mimics chaotic dynamics observed in natural populations. STRC manifests itself when deterministic changes in a system parameter interrupt chaotic behavior at unpredictable intervals. Numerical results reinforce an earlier suggestion that period-doubling reversals could control chaotic dynamics in ecological models. In ecological terms, the prey and intermediate predator populations may go to extinction in the event of a catastrophe. The top predator is always a survivor. In contrast to this, this is not the case when the constituent populations are interacting through Holling type II functional response. Even this top predator can go to extinction in the event of such catastrophes.","13925113, 23358963",2.832

The coexistence of two or more distinct attractors on the same set of parametric values in nonlinear dynamical systems suggests that the environmental forces may alter the dynamical regimes of these systems. Two-dimensional parameter scans suggest that even smooth (periodic or seasonal) perturbations, which bring changes in system parameters and thus decide dynamical modes to be displayed in a particular situation, are able to induce variations in these modes.

Exploring the dynamics of a Holling–Tanner model with cannibalism in both predator and prey population,International Journal of Biomathematics,"Cannibalism is an intriguing life history trait, that has been considered primarily in the predator, in predator–prey population models. Recent experimental evidence shows that prey cannibalism can have a significant impact on predator–prey population dynamics in natural communities. Motivated by these experimental results, we investigate a ratio-dependent Holling–Tanner model, where cannibalism occurs simultaneously in both the predator and prey species. We show that depending on parameters, whilst prey or predator cannibalism acting alone leads to instability, their joint effect can actually stabilize the unstable interior equilibrium. Furthermore, in the spatially explicit model, we find that depending on parameters, prey and predator cannibalism acting jointly can cause spatial patterns to form, while not so acting individually.

Trophic structure and dynamical complexity in simple ecological models,ecological complexity,"We study the dynamical complexity of five non-linear deterministic predator–prey model systems. These simple systems were selected to represent a diversity of trophic structures and ecological interactions in the real world while still preserving reasonable tractability. We find that these systems can dramatically change attractor types, and the switching among different attractors is dependent on system parameters. While dynamical complexity depends on the nature (e.g., inter-specific competition versus predation) and degree (e.g., number of interacting components) of trophic structure present in the system, these systems all evolve principally on intrinsically noisy limit cycles. Our results support the common observation of cycling and rare observation of chaos in natural populations.

The epidemic model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the disease-free and unique endemic equilibria. Existence and local stability of these equilibria are explored. Using central manifold theory, it is established that the transcritical bifurcation occurs when basic reproduction number passes through unity. The proposed Ebola epidemic model provides an estimate to the potential number of future cases. The model indicates that the disease will decline after peaking if …","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Dynamics of an ecological model living on the edge of chaos,Applied Mathematics and Computation,"We present a new ecological model, which displays “edge of chaos” (EoC) in parameter space. This suggests that ecological systems are not chaotic, instead, their dynamics can be characterized as short-term recurrent chaos. The system’s dynamics is unpredictable and admits bursts of short-term predictability. We also provide results, which suggest that fully developed chaos will rarely be observed in natural systems.","00963003, 18735649",3.991
Observability of chaos and cycles in ecological systems: lessons from predator–prey models,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"We examine and assess deterministic chaos as an observable. First, we present the development of model ecological systems. We illustrate how to apply the Kolmogorov theorem to obtain limits on the parameters in the system, which assure the existence of either stable equilibrium point or stable limit cycle behavior in the phase space of two-dimensional (2D) dynamical systems. We also illustrate the method of deriving conditions using the linear stability analysis. We apply these procedures on some basic existing model ecological systems. Then, we propose four model ecological systems to study the dynamical chaos (chaos and intermittent chaos) and cycles. Dynamics of two predation and two competition models have been explored. The predation models have been designed by linking two predator–prey communities, which differ from one another in one essential way: the predator in the first is specialist and …","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Species extinction problem: genetic vs ecological factors,Applied Mathematical Modelling,"Conservation biologists have been facing an intriguing question: whether it is genetic or ecological factors which govern the ecological systems. In this paper, we have constructed a few model systems describing real ecological situations and analysed them using a methodology designed for the purpose. Simulation experiments suggest that both these factors should be given equal weightage in working out strategies for any conservation effort. We conclude that the complex ecosystems are safe places for species belonging to the higher life forms, especially, generalist predators. On the contrary, simple (small) ecosystems cannot harbour these species for long. Another useful observation is that the vertebrate predators should be preferred to their invertebrate counterparts while aiming at conserving endangered prey species.",0307904X,5.175
Modeling and control of computer virus attack on a targeted network,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"In this paper, a model with two different frameworks of an attacking class and a targeted class is introduced to study the virus mobility of an attack in a targeted network.

It is observed that as R 0 crosses unity, transcritical bifurcation arises in the system. The effect of firewall security is also shown graphically which has been taken as a media coverage factor in this work and it is discovered that firewall helps to bring down the virus propagation by reducing the infection peak. Optimal control concept is then introduced to propose one more measure for regulating the virus propagation. Numerical experimentations have been done to rationalize the analytical conclusions.

In the present study, the interaction between population and their independent and combined selective harvesting are framed by a multi-delayed prey-predator system. Depending upon the age selection strategy, system experiences stable coexistence to oscillatory mode and vice versa via Hopf-bifurcation. Economic evolution of the system which is mainly featured by maximum sustainable yield (MSY), bionomic equilibrium and optimal harvesting vary largely with the commensurate age selections of both population because equilibrium population abundance becomes age-selection dependent.

Long time dynamics of a three-species food chain model with Allee effect in the top predator,Computers & Mathematics with Applications,"The Allee effect is an important phenomenon in population biology characterized by positive density dependence, that is a positive correlation between population density and individual fitness. However, the effect is not well studied in multi-level trophic food chains. We consider a ratio dependent spatially explicit three species food chain model, where the top predator is subjected to a strong Allee effect. We show the existence of a global attractor for the model, that is upper semicontinuous in the Allee threshold parameter m. Next, we numerically investigate the decay rate to a target attractor, that is when m= 0, in terms of m. We find decay estimates that are O (m γ), where γ is found explicitly.

Exploring the dynamics of a tritrophic food chain model with multiple gestation periods,Math. Biosci. Eng,"This work is mainly focused on the series of dynamical analysis of tritrophic food chain model with Sokol-Howell functional response, incorporating the multiple gestation time delays for more realistic formulation. Basic properties of the proposed model are studied with the help of boundedness, stability analysis, and Hopf-bifurcation theory. By choosing the fixed parameter set and varying the value of time delay, the stability of the model has been studied. There is a critical value for the delay parameter. Steady state is stable when the value of delay is less than the critical value and a further increase in the value of delay beyond the critical value makes the system oscillatory through Hopf-bifurcation. Whereas, another delay parameter has a stabilizing effect on the system dynamics. Chaotic dynamics has been explored in the model with the help of phase portrait and sensitivity on initial condition test.

"Modeling wetland systems of Keoladeo National Park (KNP), India: the role of space",Wetlands ecology and management,"The essential dynamics of biotic interactions in Keoladeo National Park, Rajasthan, India has been modeled by a reaction–diffusion system. Entire species are grouped into three categories: (i) good biomass, (ii) bad biomass and (iii) avian predators (resident as well as migratory birds). The good biomass, which consists of fishes and a few plant species eaten by small fishes, serves as food for birds. The functional response of avian predators is assumed to be of Beddington–DeAngelis type, which considers per capita rate of predation to be a function of the intensity of interference among individuals of predator populations. Simulation studies reveal that this parameter plays an important role in deciding the dynamics of the KNP system. Higher values of the intensity of interference mean bad health of the park.

Wave phenomena and edge of chaos in a diffusive predator-prey system under Allee effect,Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems,"We investigate a spatial predator-prey system; predator under Allee effect. The predator-prey community dynamics is assumed to be of Holling-Tanner type. When community’s local dynamics displays sustained periodic oscillations, the system’s spatio-temporal dynamics supports periodic traveling waves.

We have studied a predator–prey interaction system with mutually interfering predator by considering additional food and Crowley–Martin functional response (CMFR) for both the reaction–diffusion model and associated spatially homogeneous system. The local stability analysis ensures that as the quantity of alternative food decreases, predator-free equilibrium stabilizes. Moreover, we have also obtained a condition providing a threshold value of additional food for the global asymptotic stability of coexisting steady state.

Since no proper treatment is available till date and the vaccination is restricted to certain age groups, also vaccine efficacy is still under progress, the emphasis has been given to the method of isolation and quarantine. This control is induced by tracing the contacts of the infectious individuals, putting them to the quarantine class and based on their symptoms, classifying them either as the susceptible or sick individuals and moving the sick individuals to the isolated class. To track the current pandemic situation of COVID-19 in India, we consider an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Quarantine-Infected-Isolated-Recovered (SEQ1IQ2R) compartmental model along with calculating its control reproductive number Rc. The disease can be kept in control if the value of Rc remains below one. This “threshold” value of Rc is used to optimize the period of quarantine, and isolation and have been calculated in order to eradicate the disease. The sensitivity analysis of Rc with respect to the quarantine and isolation period has also been done. Partial rank correlation coefficient method is applied to identify the most significant parameters involved in Rc.

Modelling Predator–Prey Interactions: A Trade-Off between Seasonality and Wind Speed,Mathematics,"Predator–prey interactions do not solely depend on biotic factors: rather, they depend on many other abiotic factors also. One such abiotic factor is wind speed, which can crucially change the predation efficiency of the predator population. In this article, the impact of wind speed along with seasonality on various parameters has been investigated. Here, we present two continuous-time models with specialist and generalist type predators incorporating the effect of wind and the seasonality on the model parameters. It has been observed that wind speed plays a significant role in controlling the system dynamics for both systems. It makes the systems stable for both of the seasonally unperturbed systems. However, it controls the chaotic dynamics that occur in case of no wind for the seasonally perturbed system with the predator as a specialist. On the other hand, for the seasonally perturbed system with a generalist predator, it controls period-four oscillations (which occur considering no wind speed) to simple limit-cycle oscillations. Furthermore, the wind parameter has a huge impact on the survival of predator species. The survival of predator species may be achieved by ensuring a suitable range of wind speeds in the ecosystem. Therefore, we observe that seasonality introduces chaos, but wind reduces it. These results may be very useful for adopting necessary management for the conservation of endangered species that are massively affected by wind speed in an ecosystem.",22277390,2.617

Blow-Up Dynamics and Synchronization in Tri-Trophic Food Chain Models,Algorithms,"Synchronization of food chain models is an intensely investigated area in dynamical systems. Two pioneering models in three species food chain systems exhibiting chaotic dynamics are the Hastings and Powell (HP) model and the Upadhyay and Rai (UR) model. These are known to synchronize, even though the top predators in the two models behave differently. In the current manuscript, we show that although the HP and UR models synchronize for certain initial conditions, they do not synchronize for arbitrarily large initial conditions due to the blow-up dynamics present in the UR model. Thus, the synchronization of these model systems is purely a local (in initial data) phenomenon. Interestingly, we find that a similar result holds for the modified UR model as well, which has global in-time solutions for any positive initial condition. Thus, the lack of synchrony could also be attributed to the difference in the top predator’s feeding preferences in the model systems. Our results have large-scale applications to population synchrony in tri-trophic food chains.",19994893,2.39

"Emergence of Spatial Patterns in a Model of Wetland Ecosystem: Application to Keoladeo National Park (KNP), India",TURING,"An attempt has been made to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of good biomass (fishes and floating vegetation like Nymphoides indicum, Nymphaea nouchali etc.), bad biomass (Paspalum distichum and its family) and bird population in the biotic system of the wetland part of Keoladeo National Park (KNP), India. Spatiotemporal distributions of species biomass are simulated using the diffusivity assumptions realistic for natural wetland systems. We observed that growth rate and carrying capacity of water availability for the bad biomass, higher value of the carrying capacity and half saturation constant of the good biomass are responsible for the good health of the wetland ecosystem. The study also demonstrates that spatial movements of good biomass acquires stable stationary patterns in the presence of bad biomass which performs swinging motion and selects a steady state spatial pattern, thereby ensuring the persistence as well as extinction of multiple species in space and time. The patterns observed seem to have a similar structure that is uniformity in space, with plateau for good biomass, concentration onto two distinct humps for bad biomass, and extinction for bird population. This will usually be the case in real world scenarios, unless the parameter controlling the death rate of bird population is sufficiently decreased. The mechanisms evolved for the space time survival of these species are thus regulated by interspecific spatial interaction.

Many forms of complex dynamics are observed, including period-doubling bifurcation with period-halving bifurcation cascade, saddle–node bifurcation.

Adaptive control and synchronization of chaotic systems consisting of Van der Pol oscillators coupled to linear oscillators,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals",This paper deals with the problem of control and synchronization of coupled second-order oscillators showing a chaotic behavior. A classical feedback controller is first used to stabilize the system at its equilibrium. An adaptive observer is then designed to synchronize the states of the master and slave oscillators using a single scalar signal corresponding to an observable state variable of the driving oscillator. An interesting feature of the proposed approach is that it can be used for chaos control as well as synchronization purposes. Numerical simulations results confirming the analytical predictions are shown and pspice simulations are also performed to confirm the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.,09600779,5.969

Modeling Ebola virus disease transmissions with reservoir in a complex virus life ecology,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences,"We propose a new deterministic mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in a complex Ebola virus life ecology. Our model captures as much as possible the features and patterns of the disease evolution as a three cycle transmission process in the two ways below. Firstly it involves the synergy between the epizootic phase (during which the disease circulates periodically amongst non-human primates populations and decimates them), the enzootic phase (during which the disease always remains in fruit bats population) and the epidemic phase (during which the EVD threatens and decimates human populations). Secondly it takes into account the well-known, the probable/suspected and the hypothetical transmission mechanisms (including direct and indirect routes of contamination) between and within the three different types of populations consisting of humans, animals and fruit bats. The reproduction number R0 for the full model with the environmental contamination is derived and the global asymptotic stability of the disease free equilibrium is established when R0andlt;1. It is conjectured that there exists a unique globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium for the full model when R0andgt;1.

Modelling coffee leaf rust dynamics to control its spread,Mathematical Modelling of Natural Phenomena,"Coffee leaf rust (CLR) is one of the main diseases that affect coffee plantations worldwide. It is caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix. Damages induce severe yield losses (up to 70%). Its control mainly relies on cultural practices and fungicides, the latter having harmful ecological impact and important cost. Our goal is to understand the propagation of this fungus in order to propose a biocontrol solution, based on a mycoparasite that inhibits H. vastatrix reproduction. We develop and explore a spatio-temporal model that describes CLR propagation in a coffee plantation during the rainy and dry seasons. We show the existence of a solution and prove that there exists two threshold parameters, the dry and rainy basic reproduction numbers, that determine the stability of the equilibria for the dry and rainy season subsystems. To illustrate these theoretical results, numerical simulations are performed, using a non …","09735348, 17606101",2.544
A metapopulation model for the population dynamics of anopheles mosquito,Applied Mathematics and Computation,"A more robust assessment of malaria control will come from a better understanding of the distribution and connectivity of breeding and blood feeding sites. Spatial heterogeneity of mosquito resources, such as hosts and breeding sites, affects mosquito dispersal behavior. This paper analyzes and simulates the spreading of anopheles mosquito on a complex metapopulation, that is, networks of populations connected by migratory flows whose configurations are described in terms of connectivity distribution of nodes (patches) and the conditional probabilities of connections between nodes. We examine the impacts of vector dispersal on the persistence and extinction of a mosquito population in both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes.

A patchy model for chikungunya-like diseases,Biomath,"We consider a n-patches model, to study the impact of human population movements between cities (patches) in the spread of Chikungunya or even Dengue diseases. In previous works, it was showed that the basic reproduction number can vary from place to place, but this result was obtained without taking into account human movements. We provide a theoretical study of the patchy model, and derive the basic reproduction number, which may depend on Human movement rates between the patches and on local population sizes. We show that the basic reproduction number is bounded by the maximum of local basic reproduction number. We also show that there exists a disease-free equilibrium (DFE) that is locally asymptotically stable whenever the basic reproduction number is less than 1. Under suitable assumptions, DFE is even globally asymptotically stable. We emphasize that Human movements are of particular importance to evaluate the spreading or not of Chikungunya or Dengue diseases, and thus movement rates have to be estimated very accurately. We confirm also the importance of the local basic reproduction numbers and show that even local field interventions can be of benefit to control/reduce the spread of a disease. A complete analytical study for a 2-patches model and several examples are provided to illustrate our conclusion.","1314684X, 13147218",1.158

Reduced-order synchronization of uncertain chaotic systems via adaptive control,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"We consider the coupling of two uncertain dynamical systems with different orders using an adaptive feedback linearization controller to achieve reduced-order synchronization between the two systems. Reduced-order synchronization is the problem of synchronization of a slave system with projection of a master system. The synchronization scheme is an exponential linearizing-like controller and a state/uncertainty estimator. As an illustrative example, we show that the dynamical evolution of a second-order driven oscillator can be synchronized with the canonical projection of a fourth-order chaotic system. Simulation results indicated that the proposed control scheme can significantly improve the synchronousness performance.

A generic modelling of fire impact in a tree-grass savanna model,Biomath,"We propose and study a model for tree-grass interactions in the context of savannas which are subjected to fire pressure. Several theoretical models in the literature which have highlighted the impact of fire on tree-grass interactions did not explicitly deal with the indirect feedback of dry grass biomass onto tree dynamics through fire intensity and frequency. The novelty in our work is to consider a fairly generic modeling of fire impact on woody biomass by means of a family of increasing and bounded functions of grass biomass. The characteristic feature of this family of functions is that, it could include several forms: linear as well as non-linear ones (sigmoidal or not). Since the nonlinear shape brings more diverse results than the previous attempts using a linear function, it could be used to show that several vegetation equilibria exist with some of them showing tree-grass coexistence features. We show that the number of equilibria with both grass and trees depends on the choice of the fire impact function. We also established thresholds defining the stability domains of the equilibria and highlighted some bifurcation parameters to provide numerical simulations complying with the theoretical properties of the model.","1314684X, 13147218",1.158

Using the Lyapunov stability theory, we show that the synchronization of two coupled chaotic systems can be achieved by means of a linear coupling. A remarkable feature of the proposed approach is that it is robust with respect to noise and parameter mismatch. Numerical simulation of the Chua's circuit verifies the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed adaptive synchronization scheme.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Spatiotemporal dynamics and optimal control of glioma virotherapy enhanced by MEK Inhibitors,Results In Control And Optimization,"Over the last few years, glioma tumors has been recognized as one of the most devastating cancer types, where as glioblastoma represents its advanced stage when the prognosis is worst. Great expectation in the cancer therapy field have been generated in recent advances in oncolytic immunotherapy. One of such immune-related therapeutic alternative is the use of oncolytic virus (OVs), particularly with oncolytic adenoviruses (OAds). In fact, OVs can destroy the cancer cells and stimulate a tumor specific immune response in such a way to return the proficiency of tumors to get a way on the control of immune system. Combination of virotherapy with Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors is a promising alternative to conventional therapies during glioma tumor treatment.

Synergistic effects of oncolytic adenovirus and MEK inhibitors on glioma treatment dynamics: Analysis and optimal control,Applied Mathematical Sciences,"In this paper, we investigate the dynamics and optimal control of a combination therapy model of glioma with adenoviruses and MEK inhibitors. We provide a theoretical study of the model. We derive the basic reproduction number R0 which determines the extinction and the persistence of adenovirus in the tumor environment. More precisely, we compute equilibria and study their stability. Based on Lyapunov theory, we show that the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable whenever R0< 1. However, if R0> 1, there exist a unique uniform equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable. The sensitivity analysis of R0 is performed in order to determine the impact of related parameters on therapy. Furthermore, the model can present a Hopf bifurcation. Finally, we applied the optimal control to our model and we found that, through an optimisation of a combined oncolytic virotherapy and MEK inhibitors.

Mathematical Analysis of a General Two‐Patch Model of Tuberculosis Disease with Lost Sight Individuals,Abstract and Applied Analysis,"A two‐patch model, SEi1 … EinIiLi,  i = 1,2, is used to analyze the spread of tuberculosis, with an arbitrary number n of latently infected compartments in each patch. A fraction of infectious individuals that begun their treatment will not return to the hospital for the examination of sputum. This fact usually occurs in sub‐Saharan Africa, due to many reasons. The model incorporates migrations from one patch to another. The existence and uniqueness of the associated equilibria are discussed. A Lyapunov function is used to show that when the basic reproduction ratio is less than one, the disease‐free equilibrium is globally and asymptotically stable.

Accounting the control effort to improve chaos suppression via robust adaptive feedback,"International Journal of Modelling, Identification and Control","This contribution deals with the optimisation of the chaos suppression via robust (low-parameterised) adaptive feedback. The robust adaptive feedback (RAF) has been proved to be capable of inducing the chaos suppression in face of uncertainties and exogenous disturbances. In this contribution the RAF scheme is accomplished with an optimal tuning scheme based on Riccatti equations. The underlying idea is to optimise the robust chaos suppression by accounting the control effort despite the saturation in electronic components. A finite horizon can be arbitrarily established by ensuring that the chaos suppression is achieved at established time. It should be noted that there is not exact convergence to the non-chaotic reference. As a matter of fact, only the suppression of the chaotic behaviour is aimed.

Modelling and control of coffee berry borer infestation,HAL,"Coffee plays an important role in the economic growth of many developing countries. Coffee production throughout the world is affected by several pests and diseases. Among these pests, the coffee berry borer (CBB), Hypothenemus hampei, is considered as the most important pest economically. The CBB is a beetle that feeds and spends its development cycle in the coffee berries, causing direct crop losses and a lowering of the coffee quality. Mature females are responsible for the dispersal of the population: they emerge from the berries to colonise and lay their eggs in new berries, while males and juvenile stages remain inside the berries. Several control methods have been developed to fight these insects: pesticides, but also cultural practices, biological control and trapping. Our global aim is to design and assess the efficiency of control strategies, with a focus on alternatives to pesticides. To tackle this issue, we developed a mathematical model that describes the infestation dynamics of coffee berries by CBB, based on the insect life-cycle and including the berry availability during a cropping season. We aim at maximising the yield at the end of cropping season, while minimising the CBB population and the control costs. We show the existence of an optimal solution and solve the problem numerically. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate our results.","01616420, 15494713",6.35

"Predator-prey model with prey harvesting, Holling response function of type III and SIS disease",Biomath,"The populations of prey and predator interact with prey harvesting. When there is no predator, the logistic equation models the behavior of the preys. For interactions between preys and predators, we use the generalized Holling response function of type III. This function which models the consumption of preys by predators is such that the predation rate of predators increases when the preys are few and decreases when they reach their satiety. Our main goal is to analyze the influence of a SIS infectious disease in the community. The epidemiological SIS model with simple mass incidence is chosen, where only susceptibles and infectious are counted. We assume firstly that the disease spreads only among the prey population and secondly that it spreads only among the predator population. There are many bifurcations as: Hopf bifurcation, transcritical bifurcation and saddle-node bifurcation. The results indicate that either the disease dies out or persists and then, at least one population can disappear because of infection. For some particular choices of the parameters however, there exists endemic equilibria in which both populations survive.

For the submodel without phage absorption, the basic reproduction number is computed. The disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is shown to be globally asymptotically stable whenever is less than one, while a unique globally asymptotically endemic equilibrium is proven whenever exceeds one. In the presence of phage absorption, the above stated classical condition based on , as the average number of secondary human infections produced by susceptible/lysogen bacteria during their entire lifespan, is no longer sufficient to guarantee the global stability of the DFE. We thus derive an additional threshold , which is the average offspring number of …","17935245, 17937159",3.117
Mathematical modelling and optimal control of production losses caused by Miridae,Mathematical Modelling of Natural Phenomena,"Cocoa mirid, Sahlbergella singulars, is the major pest of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) responsible of several damage in plots in West Africa and particularly in Cameroon. Occasional damage accounts for 30 40% of pod losses. However, when miridae affect the foliage, gradual wilting occurs and eventually, tree death. A few studies have focused on describing the time evolution of Miridae in the plot in Cameroon, yet numerous questions remain. The aim of this paper is to estimate and control the losses of production caused by the bites of miridea. To do this, we will formulate and study a mathematical model for the dynamics of pods that takes into account the feeding and egg-laying of adults miridae on pods. We present the theoretical analysis of the model. More precisely, we compute equilibria and derive a threshold parameter that determines the presence or not of miridae in the plot.

Modeling the Influence of Desert Aerosols on the Transmission Dynamics of Neisseria Meningitidis Serogroup A.,Applications & Applied Mathematics,"This paper assesses the role of desert aerosols and vaccine on the transmission dynamics of Neisseria Meningitis serogroup A (NmA). It is biologically well-documented that the inhalation of aerosol dust and its presence in the nasal cavity weakens the nasopharyngeal mucosa by damaging the mucosal barrier and inhibiting the mucosal immune defenses of susceptible and vaccinated individuals. We address the latter by proposing and analyzing a mathematical model for the dynamics of NmA that specifically accounts for the fast progression of susceptible and vaccinated individuals to the invasive stage of the disease. We compute the basic reproduction number and use it to investigate the existence and stability of equilibria. In this regard, we prove that the model undergoes a backward bifurcation phenomenon. We highlight the detrimental impact of aerosol dust by showing that its inhalation augments the …","08954798, 10957162",1.816
Bifurcation analysis in a serogroup a meningococcal infection model,Commun. Math. Biol. Neurosci.,"A mathematical model is formulated that enables the understanding of the dynamics of the transmission of serogroup A meningococcal (MenA) infection. We provide the theoretical analysis of the model. We compute the basic reproduction number R0 and shows that the outcome of the disease depends on a threshold parameter ξ. More precisely, we show that when R0≤ ξ, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while when ξ≤ R0≤ 1, the model exhibits the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, when a stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with one or more stable endemic equilibria. Sensitivity analysis of the model has been performed in order to determine the impact of related parameters on meningitis outbreak. Random perturbation of the vaccine efficacy was performed to gain insight into the role of the vaccine efficacy on the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations, which further suggest that the control of the epidemic of MenA pass through a combination of a large coverage vaccination of young susceptible individuals and the production of a vaccine with a high level of efficacy.",20522541,0.644
DYNAMICS OF AN INTRA-HOST MODEL OF MALARIA WITH A CONSTANT DRUG EFFICIENCY,Journal of Applied Analysis & Computation,"In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of an intra-host model of malaria with logistic red blood growth, treatment and immune response. We provide a theoretical study of the model. We derive the basic reproduction number Rf which determines the extinction and the persistence of malaria within the body of a host. We compute equilibria and study their stability. More precisely, we show that there exists a threshold parameter ζ such that if Rf≤ ζ≤ 1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. However, if Rf> 1, there exist two malaria infection equilibria which are locally asymptotically stable: one malaria infection equilibrium without immune response and one malaria infection equilibrium with immune response. The sensitivity analysis of the model has been performed in order to determine the impact of related parameters on outbreak severity. The theory is supported by numerical simulations. We also derive a spatio-temporal model, using Diffusion-Reaction equations to model parasites dispersal. Finally, we provide numerical simulations for parasites spreading, and test different treatment scenarios.","2156907X, 21585644",1.107
Modelling and analysis of a within-host model of hepatitis B and D co-infections,Biomath,"The Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a defect RNA virus that requires the presence of the hepatitis virus (HBV) for cellular infection. A co-infection may result in a more severe acute disease and a higher risk of developing acute liver failure compared with those infected with HBV alone. At the present time, there has been very little to the modeling of HDV. The derivation and analysis of such a mathematical model poses difficulty as it requires the inclusion of (HBV). In this paper, a within-host model for the co-interaction of HDV and HBV is presented and rigorously analyzed. We calculate the basic reproduction number (Ro), the disease-free equilibrium, boundary equilibrium, which we define as the existence of one disease along with the complete eradication of the other disease, and the co-infection equilibrium. We determine stability criteria for the disease-free and boundary equilibrium. We also use the optimal control theory to assess the disease control.

"Models for Miridae, a cocoa insect pest. Application in control strategies",Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,"Cocoa mirid, Sahlbergella singularis, is one of the major pests of cocoa in West Africa. It is responsible of several damages in plots. In this paper, we study the dynamics of this pest. Based on biological and ecological partial knowledge, we develop 2 cooperative mathematical models that aim to describe the time dynamics of the cocoa mirids. We first develop a cooperative stage‐structured model, derived some qualitative results, and a sensitivity analysis study in order to determine the most important parameters. Assuming that all parameters are or not periodic, we obtain conditions that allow the persistence or not of the population. We highlight the influence of cocoa pods variation along the year on the time evolution of the population. Then, we derive a 2‐stage cooperative time‐delay model, with 2 delays, that takes into account the eggs' development time and the females' maturation time. We illustrate our theoretical results with some simulations and show that the delayed system provides the best results compared with real observations. Finally, we focus on chemical control that is commonly used in Cameroon and compare it to a new biological control, mixing mating disrupting and trapping. We discuss the results and provide future perspectives based on this work.","14337851, 15213773",15.737
Modelling of Infection Mildew of Taro (Phytophthora colocasiae),Plant,"Mildew taro caused by Phytophthora colocasiae affection is the most devastating of taro cultivation in Cameroon since 2010. It has been studied in leading the influence that can have a parameter considered favourable in the kinetics of the disease, and secondly, the interaction between plots through zoospores that can move from one field to another while estimating their dispersal throughout the plant. These models have allowed us to demonstrate that the duration of pathogen latency period, the number of sporangia produced on the surface of a lesion as well as the severity of the infection taken individually, are parameters to be taken into account in the development of a variety resistant to late blight taro. The dynamics of the fungus over time is represented by a matrix. The latter was used to establish a detailed estimate of the number of new infections caused by a sporangium placed in a landscape of healthy leaves. This number is known as the net rate of breeding base name (R0). The incidence and severity of disease are significantly reduced when the rate is less than or equal to one. So our approach can be used to guide research programs or evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies to design throughout the plant.","10404651, 1532298X",7.187
Mathematical analysis of a non-local tree-grass interactions model for savanna ecosystems experiencing pulse fire perturbations,INRA,"The aim of this talk is to present a spatio-temporal tree-grass interactions model within fireprone savanna ecosystems. Fires and mean annual rainfall are major factors that regulate woody and grassy biomasses in savanna ecosystems. Savannas display several spatial structures along the climatic gradient and the goal of this paper is to analyze and explain, with a mathematical model, how these spatial structures may occur and behave. In savanna biomes, biotic interactions between plants influence the dynamics of woody and herbaceous communities and therefore the dynamics of the savanna. Although facilitative interactions are relevant in areas with abiotic stress, such as arid and semi-arid ecosystems, competitive interactions also take place in those ecosystems. Competitive and facilitative interactions frequently act simultaneously, usually affecting woody and herbaceous communities at different spatial scales. While facilitation is a local process, competition for limiting resources (mainly water in arid and semi-arid environments, and light availability in tropical regions) can present a longer range of influence. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical framework to model tree-grass interactions that takes into account, the impulsive nature of fire occurrence, size-dependent fire sensitivity (via two classes of woody plants) and spatial mechanisms of tree-grass interactions. Specifically, the proposed model acknowledges local seed production, non-local seed dispersion as well as non-local competition/facilitation that may exist between vegetation components.

"Predator-Prey Model with Prey Harvesting, Holling Response Function of Type III and SIS Disease, Biomath 1 (2012), 1210231",Applied Mathematics and Computation,"The populations of prey and predator interact with prey harvesting. When there is no predator, the logistic equation models the behavior of the preys. For interactions between preys and predators, we use the generalized Holling response function of type III. This function which models the consumption of preys by predators is such that the predation rate of predators increases when the preys are few and decreases when they reach their satiety. Our main goal is to analyze the influence of a SIS infectious disease in the community. The epidemiological SIS model with simple mass incidence is chosen, where only susceptibles and infectious are counted. We assume firstly that the disease spreads only among the prey population and secondly that it spreads only among the predator population. There are many bifurcations as: Hopf bifurcation, transcritical bifurcation and saddle-node bifurcation. The results indicate that either the disease dies out or persists and then, at least one population can disappear because of infection. For some particular choices of the parameters however, there exists endemic equilibria in which both populations survive. Numerical simulations on MATLAB and SCILAB are used to illustrate our results.","00963003, 18735649",3.991

It is shown that such changes may result from the collision of an unstable periodic orbit and a coexisting chaotic attractor. We call such collisions crises. Phenomena associated with crises include sudden changes in the size of chaotic attractors, sudden appearances of chaotic attractors (a possible route to chaos), and sudden destructions of chaotic attractors and their basins. This paper presents examples illustrating that crisis events are prevalent in many circumstances and systems, and that, just past a crisis, certain characteristic statistical behavior (whose type depends on the type of crisis) occurs. In particular the phenomenon of chaotic transients is investigated. The examples discussed illustrate crises in progressively higher dimension and include the one-dimensional quadratic map, the …",01672789,3.117
Using small perturbations to control chaos,nature,The extreme sensitivity of chaotic systems to tiny perturbations (the ‘butterfly effect’) can be used both to stabilize regular dynamic behaviours and to direct chaotic trajectories rapidly to a desired state.

We also discuss a series of relevant issues connected with chaos control, such as the targeting problem, i.e., how to bring a trajectory to a small neighborhood of a desired location in the chaotic attractor in both low and high dimensions, and point out applications for controlling fractal basin boundaries. In short, we describe procedures for stabilizing desired chaotic orbits embedded in a chaotic attractor and discuss the issues of communicating with chaos by controlling symbolic sequences and of synchronizing chaotic systems.

Strange attractors that are not chaotic,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"It is shown that in certain types of dynamical systems it is possible to have attractors which are strange but not chaotic. Here we use the word strange to refer to the geometry or shape of the attracting set, while the word chaotic refers to the dynamics of orbits on the attractor (in particular, the exponential divergence of nearby trajectories). We first give examples for which it can be demonstrated that there is a strange nonchaotic attractor. These examples apply to a class of maps which model nonlinear oscillators (continuous time) which are externally driven at two incommensurate frequencies. It is then shown that such attractore are persistent under perturbations which preserve the original system type (i.e., there are two incommensurate external driving frequencies). This suggests that, for systems of the typw which we have considered, nonchaotic strange attractors may be expected to occur for a finite interval of …",01672789,3.117
Fractal basin boundaries,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Basin boundaries for dynamical systems can be either smooth or fractal. This paper investigates fractal basin boundaries. One practical consequence of such boundaries is that they can lead to great difficulty in predicting to which attractor a system eventually goes. The structure of fractal basin boundaries can be classified as being either locally connected or locally disconnected. Examples and discussion of both types of structures are given, and it appears that fractal basin boundaries should be common in typical dynamical systems.

We illustrate this using a simple numerical electrical oscillator model.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Critical exponents for crisis-induced intermittency,Physical Review A,"We consider three types of changes that attractors can undergo as a system parameter is varied. The first type leads to the sudden destruction of a chaotic attractor. The second type leads to the sudden widening of a chaotic attractor. In the third type of change, which applies for many systems with symmetries, two (or more) chaotic attractors merge to form a single chaotic attractor and the merged attractor can be larger in phase-space extent than the union of the attractors before the change. All three of these types of changes are termed crises and are accompanied by a characteristic temporal behavior of orbits after the crisis. For the case where the chaotic attractor is destroyed, this characteristic behavior is the existence of chaotic transients. For the case where the chaotic attractor suddenly widens, the characteristic behavior is an intermittent bursting out of the phase-space region within which the attractor was …","24699926, 24699934",2.687

The present paper extends that of Ott, Grebogi and Yorke [Phys. Rev. Lett. 64 (1990) 1196], allowing for a more general choice of the feedback matrix and implementation to higher-dimensional systems. The method is illustrated by an application to the control of a periodically impulsively kicked dissipative mechanical system with two degrees of freedom resulting in a four-dimensional map (the “double rotor map”). A key issue addressed is that of the dependence of the average time to achieve control on the size of the perturbations and on the choice of the feedback matrix.",01672789,3.117

To understand in what sense the noisy trajectory reflects the true dynamics of the actual system, we developed a rigorous procedure to show that some true trajectories remain close to the noisy one for long times. The procedure involves a combination of containment, which establishes the existence of an uncountable number of true trajectories close to the noisy one, and refinement, which produces a less noisy trajectory. Our procedure is applied to noisy chaotic trajectories of the standard map and the driven pendulum.","00319007, 10797114",8.106

Do numerical orbits of chaotic dynamical processes represent true orbits?,Journal of Complexity,"Chaotic processes have the property that relatively small numerical errors tend to grow exponentially fast. In an iterated process, if errors double each iterate and numerical calculations have 50-bit (or 15-digit) accuracy, a true orbit through a point can be expected to have no correlation with a numerical orbit after 50 iterates. On the other hand, numerical studies often involve hundreds of thousands of iterates. One may therefore question the validity of such studies. A relevant result in this regard is that of Anosov and Bowen who showed that systems which are uniformly hyperbolic will have the shadowing property: a numerical (or noisy) orbit will stay close to (shadow) a true orbit for all time. Unfortunately, chaotic processes typically studied do not have the requisite uniform hyperbolicity, and the Anosov-Bowen result does not apply.

Estimating correlation dimension from a chaotic time series: when does plateau onset occur?,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Suppose that a dynamical system has a chaotic attractor A with a correlation dimension D2. A common technique to probe the system is by measuring a single scalar function of the system state and reconstructing the dynamics in an m-dimensional space using the delay-coordinate technique. The estimated correlation dimension of the reconstructed attractor typically increases with m and reaches a plateau (on which the dimension estimate is relatively constant) for a range of large enough m values. The plateaued dimension value is then assumed to be an estimate of D2 for the attractor in the original full phase space. In this paper we first present rigorous results which state that, for a long enough data string with low enough noise, the plateau onset occurs at m = Ceil(D2), where Ceil(D2), standing for ceiling of D2, is the smallest integer greater than or equal to D2.

We find that the set in this parameter plane for which the system exhibits strange nonchaotic attractors has Cantor-like structure and is enclosed between two critical curves.

We establish properties of the riddling bifurcation that occurs when an unstable periodic orbit embedded in the chaotic attractor, usually of low period, becomes transversely unstable. An immediate physical consequence of the riddling bifurcation is that an extraordinarily low fraction of the trajectories in the invariant subspace diverge when there is a symmetry breaking.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Plateau onset for correlation dimension: When does it occur?,Physical Review Letters,"Chaotic experimental systems are often investigated using delay coordinates. Estimated values of the correlation dimension in delay coordinate space typically increase with the number of delays and eventually reach a plateau (on which the dimension estimate is relatively constant) whose value is commonly taken as an estimate of the correlation dimension D 2 of the underlying chaotic attractor. We report a rigorous result which implies that, for long enough data sets, the plateau begins when the number of delay coordinates first exceeds D 2. Numerical experiments are presented. We also discuss how lack of sufficient data can produce results that seem to be inconsistent with the theoretical prediction.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Using the sensitive dependence of chaos (the ‘‘butterfly effect’’) to direct trajectories in an experimental chaotic system,Physical Review Letters,In this paper we present the first experimental verification that the sensitivity of a chaotic system to small perturbations (the ‘‘butterfly effect’’) can be used to rapidly direct orbits from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary accessible desired state.,"00319007, 10797114",8.106
Map with more than 100 coexisting low-period periodic attractors,Physical Review E,"We study the qualitative behavior of a single mechanical rotor with a small amount of damping. This system may possess an arbitrarily large number of coexisting periodic attractors if the damping is small enough. The large number of stable orbits yields a complex structure of closely interwoven basins of attraction, whose boundaries fill almost the whole state space. Most of the attractors observed have low periods, because high period stable orbits generally have basins too small to be detected. We expect the complexity described here to be even more pronounced for higher-dimensional systems, like the double rotor, for which we find more than 1000 coexisting low-period periodic attractors.© 1996 The American Physical Society.","24700045, 24700053",2.266

Antimonotonicity: inevitable reversals of period-doubling cascades,Physics Letters A,"In many common nonlinear dynamical systems depending on a parameter, it is shown that periodic orbit creating cascades must be accompanied by periodic orbit annihilating cascades as the parameter is varied.

It is also demonstrated that these inevitable reversals are indeed observable in specific chaotic systems.","00036951, 10773118",3.462
Metamorphoses of basin boundaries in nonlinear dynamical systems,Physical Review Letters,"A basin boundary can undergo sudden changes in its character as a system parameter passes through certain critical values. In particular, basin boundaries can suddenly jump in position and can change from being smooth to being fractal.

The forced damped pendulum (Josephson junction) is used to illustrate these phenomena.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Attractors on an N-torus: Quasiperiodicity versus chaos,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"The occurrence of quasiperiodic motions in nonconservative dynamical systems is of great fundamental importance. However, current understanding concerning the question of how prevalent such motions should be is incomplete. With this in mind, the types of attractors which can exist for flows on an N-torus are studied numerically for N = 3 and 4. Specifically, nonlinear perturbations are applied to maps representing N-frequency quasiperiodic attractors. These perturbations can cause the original N-frequency quasiperiodic attractors to bifurcate to other types of attractors. Our results show that for small and moderate nonlinearity the frequency of occurrence of quasiperiodic motions is as follows: N-frequency quasiperiodic attractors are the most common, followed by (N - 1)-frequency quasiperiodic attractors,…, followed by periodic attractors. However, as the nonlinearity is further increased, N-frequency …",01672789,3.117

The method is validated by using a variety of model networks and by conducting an actual experiment to reconstruct a social network.

Routes to chaotic scattering,Physical Review Letters,"The onset of chaotic behavior in a class of classical scattering problems is shown to occur in two possible ways. One is abrupt and is related to a change in the topology of the energy surface. The other arises as a result of a complex sequence of saddle-node and period doubling bifurcations. The abrupt bifurcation represents a new generic route to chaos and yields a characteristic scaling of the frac-tal dimension associated with the scattering function as [ln (E c-E)− 1]− 1, for particle energies E near the critical value E c at which the scattering becomes chaotic.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Extracting unstable periodic orbits from chaotic time series data,Physical Review E,"A general nonlinear method to extract unstable periodic orbits from chaotic time series is proposed. By utilizing the estimated local dynamics along a trajectory, we devise a transformation of the time series data such that the transformed data are concentrated on the periodic orbits. Thus, one can extract unstable periodic orbits from a chaotic time series by simply looking for peaks in a finite grid approximation of the distribution function of the transformed data. Our method is demonstrated using data from both numerical and experimental examples, including neuronal ensemble data from mammalian brain slices.

Predicting tipping points in mutualistic networks through dimension reduction,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"Complex networked systems ranging from ecosystems and the climate to economic, social, and infrastructure systems can exhibit a tipping point (a “point of no return”) at which a total collapse of the system occurs. To understand the dynamical mechanism of a tipping point and to predict its occurrence as a system parameter varies are of uttermost importance, tasks that are hindered by the often extremely high dimensionality of the underlying system. Using complex mutualistic networks in ecology as a prototype class of systems, we carry out a dimension reduction process to arrive at an effective 2D system with the two dynamical variables corresponding to the average pollinator and plant abundances. We show, using 59 empirical mutualistic networks extracted from real data, that our 2D model can accurately predict the occurrence of a tipping point, even in the presence of stochastic disturbances.

Piecewise linear approach to an archetypal oscillator for smooth and discontinuous dynamics,"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","In a recent paper we examined a model of an arch bridge with viscous damping subjected to a sinusoidally varying central load. We showed how this yields a useful archetypal oscillator which can be used to study the transition from smooth to discontinuous dynamics as a parameter, α, tends to zero. Decreasing this smoothness parameter (a non-dimensional measure of the span of the arch) changes the smooth load–deflection curve associated with snap-buckling into a discontinuous sawtooth. The smooth snap-buckling curve is not amenable to closed-form theoretical analysis, so we here introduce a piecewise linearization that correctly fits the sawtooth in the limit at α=0. Using a Hamiltonian formulation of this linearization, we derive an analytical expression for the unperturbed homoclinic orbit, and make a Melnikov analysis to detect the homoclinic tangling under the perturbation of damping and driving.

Fractal boundaries for exit in Hamiltonian dynamics,Physical Review A,"Fractal boundaries can occur for certain situations involving chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In particular, situations are considered in which an orbit can exit from the system in one of several different ways, and the question is asked which of these ways applies for a given initial condition. As an illustration, specific examples are considered for which there are two possible ways in which a particle can exit from the system. We examine the space of initial conditions to see which of the two exit possibilities applies for each initial condition. It is found that the regions of initial-condition state space corresponding to the two exit modes are separated by a boundary that has both fractal and smooth (nonfractal) regions, for one example, and by a fractal boundary for the other example. Furthermore, it is found for the example where the boundary has fractal and smooth regions that these regions are intertwined on arbitrarily fine …","24699926, 24699934",2.687
Wireless communication with chaos,Physical Review Letters,"The modern world fully relies on wireless communication.

We show that, though <?format ?>a chaotic signal is strongly modified by the wireless physical media, its Lyapunov exponents remain unaltered, suggesting that the information transmitted is not modified by the channel. For some particular chaotic signals, we have indeed proved that the dynamic description of both the transmitted and the received signals is identical and shown that the capacity of the chaos-based wireless channel is unaffected by the multipath propagation of the physical media. These physical properties of chaotic signals warrant an effective chaos-based wireless communication system.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Intermingled basins and two-state on-off intermittency,Physical Review E,"We consider dynamical systems which possess two low-dimensional symmetric invariant subspaces. In each subspace, there is a chaotic attractor, and there are no other attractors in the phase space. As a parameter of the system changes, the largest Lyapunov exponents transverse to the invariant subspaces can change from negative to positive: the former corresponds to the situation where the basins of the attractors are intermingled, while the latter corresponds to the case where the system exhibits a two-state on-off intermittency. The phenomenon is investigated using a physical example where particles move in a two-dimensional potential, subjected to friction and periodic forcing.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Controlling hamiltonian chaos,Physical Review E,"The method for stabilizing an unstable periodic orbit in chaotic dynamical systems originally formulated by Ott, Grebogi, and Yorke (OGY) is not directly applicable to chaotic Hamiltonian systems. The reason is that an unstable periodic orbit in such systems often exhibits complex-conjugate eigenvalues at one or more of its orbit points. In this paper we extend the OGY stabilization method to control Hamiltonian chaos by incorporating the notion of stable and unstable directions at each periodic point. We also present an algorithm to calculate the stable and unstable directions. Other issues specific to the control of Hamiltonian chaos are also discussed.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Higher-dimensional targeting,Physical Review E,"This paper describes a procedure to steer rapidly successive iterates of an initial condition on a chaotic attractor to a small target region about any prespecified point on the attractor using only small controlling perturbations. Such a procedure is called ‘‘targeting.’’Previous work on targeting for chaotic attractors has been in the context of one-and two-dimensional maps. Here it is shown that targeting can also be done in higher-dimensional cases. The method is demonstrated with a mechanical system described by a four-dimensional mapping whose attractor has two positive Lyapunov exponents and a Lyapunov dimension of 2.8. The target is reached by making very small successive changes in a single control parameter. In one typical case, 35 iterates on average are required to reach a target region of diameter 10− 4, as compared to roughly 10 11 iterates without the use of the targeting procedure.","24700045, 24700053",2.266

Quasiperiodically forced dynamical systems with strange nonchaotic attractors,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"We discuss the existence and properties of strange nonchaotic attractors of quasiperiodically forced nonlinear dynamical systems.

When ϵ= 0 the analysis of the equation is facilitated since then it can be related to the Schrödinger equation with quasiperiodic potential. We show that the equation does indeed exhibit strange nonchaotic attractors, and we consider the important question of whether these attractors are typical in the sense that they exist on a set of positive Lebesgue measure in parameter space.(The equation also exhibits two-and three-frequency quasiperiodic behavior.) We also show that the strange nonchaotic attractors have distinctive frequency spectrum; this property might make them experimentally observable.",01672789,3.117
Modeling of an impact system with a drift,Physical Review E,"A physical model to examine impact oscillators has been developed and analyzed. The model accounts for the viscoelastic impacts and is capable to mimic the dynamics of a bounded progressive motion (a drift), which is important in practical applications. The system moves forward in stick-slip phases, and its behavior may vary from periodic to chaotic motion. A nonlinear dynamic analysis reveals a complex behavior and that the largest drift is achieved when the responses switch from periodic to chaotic, after a cascade of subcritical bifurcations to period one. Based on this fact, a semianalytical solution is constructed to calculate the progression of the system for periodic regimes and to determine conditions when periodicity is lost.","24700045, 24700053",2.266

Unstable dimension variability: A source of nonhyperbolicity in chaotic systems,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"The hyperbolicity or nonhyperbolicity of a chaotic set has profound implications for the dynamics on the set.

Here we investigate a different mechanism that can lead to nonhyperbolicity in typical invertible (respectively noninvertible) maps of dimension 3 (respectively 2) and higher. In particular, we investigate a situation (first considered by Abraham and Smale in 1970 for different purposes) in which the dimension of the unstable (and stable) tangent spaces are not constant over the chaotic set; we call this unstable dimension variability.

The nonhyperbolic parameter values are important because the dynamics in such cases is especially pathological. For example, near each such parameter value, there is another parameter value at which there are infinitely many coexisting attractors. In particular, Newhouse and Robinson (1983) proved that the existence of one nonhyperbolic parameter value typically implies the existence of an interval ('a Newhouse interval') of nonhyperbolic parameter values.

There is a transition from the former to the latter as an experimentally adjustable parameter is changed through a critical value. Accompanying this process, except for a small region about the critical value, the degree of quantum entanglement shows a trend of continuous increase.

We also show that a state of ‘‘fully developed’’chaotic scattering can be reached in our system through a process analogous to the formation of a Smale horse-shoe. By fully developed chaotic scattering, we mean that the chaotic-invariant set is hyperbolic, and we find for our problem that all bounded orbits can be coded by a full shift on three symbols.

We develop a model-free, machine-learning-based solution to both problems by exploiting reservoir computing to incorporate a parameter input channel. We demonstrate that, when the machine is trained in the normal functioning regime with a chaotic attractor (i.e., before the critical transition), the transition point can be predicted accurately. Remarkably, for a parameter drift through the critical point, the machine with the input parameter channel is able to predict not only that the system will be in a transient state, but also the distribution of the transient lifetimes and their average before the final collapse, revealing an important physical …",26431564,3.772
Characterization of the natural measure by unstable periodic orbits in chaotic attractors,Physical Review Letters,The natural measure of a chaotic set in a phase-space region can be related to the dynamical properties of the unstable periodic orbits embedded in that set. This result has been proven to be valid for hyperbolic chaotic systems. We test the goodness of such a periodic-orbit characterization of the natural measure for nonhyperbolic chaotic systems by comparing the natural measure of a typical chaotic trajectory with that computed from unstable periodic orbits. Our results suggest that the unstable periodic-orbit formulation of the natural measure is typically valid for nonhyperbolic chaotic systems.,"00319007, 10797114",8.106

Spatiotemporal dynamics in a dispersively coupled chain of nonlinear oscillators,Physical Review A,"A one-dimensional chain of forced nonlinear oscillators is investigated. This model exhibits typical behavior in periodically forced, spatially extended, nonlinear systems. At low driving amplitudes characteristic domainlike structure appears accompanied by simple asymptotic time dependence. Before reaching its final state, however, the chain behaves chaotically. The chaotic transients appear as intermittent bursts mainly concentrated at the domain walls. At higher driving, the chaotic transient becomes longer and longer until the time dependence apparently corresponds to sustained chaos with the chain state characterized by the absence of domainlike spatial structure.","24699926, 24699934",2.687
Fractal boundaries in open hydrodynamical flows: Signatures of chaotic saddles,Physical Review E,"We introduce the concept of fractal boundaries in open hydrodynamical flows based on two gedanken experiments carried out with passive tracer particles colored differently. It is shown that the signature for the presence of a chaotic saddle in the advection dynamics is a fractal boundary between regions of different colors. The fractal parts of the boundaries found in the two experiments contain either the stable or the unstable manifold of this chaotic set. We point out that these boundaries coincide with streak lines passing through appropriately chosen points. As an illustrative numerical experiment, we consider a model of the von Kármán vortex street, a time periodic two-dimensional flow of a viscous fluid around a cylinder.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Combinatorial stresses kill pathogenic Candida species,Medical mycology,"Pathogenic microbes exist in dynamic niches and have evolved robust adaptive responses to promote survival in their hosts. The major fungal pathogens of humans, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, are exposed to a range of environmental stresses in their hosts including osmotic, oxidative and nitrosative stresses. Significant efforts have been devoted to the characterization of the adaptive responses to each of these stresses. In the wild, cells are frequently exposed simultaneously to combinations of these stresses and yet the effects of such combinatorial stresses have not been explored. We have developed a common experimental platform to facilitate the comparison of combinatorial stress responses in C. glabrata and C. albicans. This platform is based on the growth of cells in buffered rich medium at 30°C, and was used to define relatively low, medium and high doses of osmotic (NaCl), oxidative …","13693786, 14602709",2.488

Scaling law for characteristic times of noise-induced crises,Physical Review A,"We consider the influence of random noise on low-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical systems with parameters near values leading to a crisis in the absence of noise. In a crisis, one of several characteristic changes in a chaotic attractor takes place as a system parameter p passes through its crisis value p c. For each type of change, there is a characteristic temporal behavior of orbits after the crisis (p> p c by convention), with a characteristic time scale τ. For an important class of deterministic systems, the dependence of τ on p is τ∼(p-p c)− γ for p slightly greater than p c. When noise is added to a system with p< p c, orbits can exhibit the same sorts of characteristic temporal behavior as in the deterministic case for p> p c (a noise-induced crisis). Our main result is that for systems whose characteristic times scale as above in the zero-noise limit, the characteristic time in the noisy case scales as τ∼ σ− γ g ((p c-p)/σ …","24699926, 24699934",2.687
Dynamical properties of a simple mechanical system with a large number of coexisting periodic attractors,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","We study a simple mechanical system consisting of two rotors that possesses a large number (3000+) of coexisting periodic attractors. A complex fractal boundary separates these tiny islands of stability and their basins of attraction. Hence, the system's long term behavior is acutely sensitive to the initial conditions. This sensitivity combined with the system's many periodic sinks give rise to a rich dynamical behavior when the system is subjected to small amplitude noise. This dynamical behavior is of great utility, and this is demonstrated by using perturbations which are smaller than the noise level to gear and influence the dynamics toward a specific periodic behavior.",09600779,5.969
Mechanisms underlying the exquisite sensitivity of Candida albicans to combinatorial cationic and oxidative stress that enhances the potent fungicidal activity of phagocytes,MBio,"Immune cells exploit reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cationic fluxes to kill microbial pathogens, such as the fungus Candida albicans. Yet, C. albicans is resistant to these stresses in vitro. Therefore, what accounts for the potent antifungal activity of neutrophils? We show that simultaneous exposure to oxidative and cationic stresses is much more potent than the individual stresses themselves and that this combinatorial stress kills C. albicans synergistically in vitro. We also show that the high fungicidal activity of human neutrophils is dependent on the combinatorial effects of the oxidative burst and cationic fluxes, as their pharmacological attenuation with apocynin or glibenclamide reduced phagocytic potency to a similar extent. The mechanistic basis for the extreme potency of combinatorial cationic plus oxidative stress—a phenomenon we term stress pathway interference—lies with the inhibition of hydrogen …","21507511, 21612129",4.783
Integrative Model of Oxidative Stress Adaptation in the Fungal Pathogen Candida albicans,PLoS One,"The major fungal pathogen of humans, Candida albicans, mounts robust responses to oxidative stress that are critical for its virulence. These responses counteract the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated by host immune cells in an attempt to kill the invading fungus. Knowledge of the dynamical processes that instigate C. albicans oxidative stress responses is required for a proper understanding of fungus-host interactions. Therefore, we have adopted an interdisciplinary approach to explore the dynamical responses of C. albicans to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Our deterministic mathematical model integrates two major oxidative stress signalling pathways (Cap1 and Hog1 pathways) with the three major antioxidant systems (catalase, glutathione and thioredoxin systems) and the pentose phosphate pathway, which provides reducing equivalents required for oxidative stress adaptation. The model encapsulates existing knowledge of these systems with new genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, molecular and cellular datasets. Our integrative approach predicts the existence of alternative states for the key regulators Cap1 and Hog1, thereby suggesting novel regulatory behaviours during oxidative stress. The model reproduces both existing and new experimental observations under a variety of scenarios. Time- and dose-dependent predictions of the oxidative stress responses for both wild type and mutant cells have highlighted the different temporal contributions of the various antioxidant systems during oxidative stress adaptation, indicating that catalase plays a critical role immediately following stress imposition. This is the first model …",19326203,3.107
Algebraic decay and fluctuations of the decay exponent in Hamiltonian systems,Physical Review A,"Particle-decay processes in a nonhyperbolic Hamiltonian system are typically characterized by algebraic laws. That is, for a fixed set of parameter values, if one initializes a particle in a chaotic region near some Kol’mogorov-Arnol’d-Moser (KAM) tori, the probability for this particle to remain in the region at time t decays with time algebraically: P (t)∼ t− z, where z is the decay exponent. As a system parameter varies, the numerically calculated exponent z exhibits rather large fluctuations. In this paper we examine the dynamical origin of such fluctuations using a model system which exhibits unbounded chaotic dynamics (ie, chaotic scattering). Our results indicate that the fluctuating behavior of z, as a function of the parameter, can be attributed to the breakup of KAM surfaces in phase space. A particularly interesting finding is that, when the outermost KAM surfaces enclosing some central island transform from absolute …","24699926, 24699934",2.687
Inference of Granger causal time-dependent influences in noisy multivariate time series,Journal of neuroscience methods,"Inferring Granger-causal interactions between processes promises deeper insights into mechanisms underlying network phenomena, e.g. in the neurosciences where the level of connectivity in neural networks is of particular interest. Renormalized partial directed coherence has been introduced as a means to investigate Granger causality in such multivariate systems. A major challenge in estimating respective coherences is a reliable parameter estimation of vector autoregressive processes. We discuss two shortcomings typical in relevant applications, i.e. non-stationarity of the processes generating the time series and contamination with observational noise. To overcome both, we present a new approach by combining renormalized partial directed coherence with state space modeling. A numerical efficient way to perform both the estimation as well as the statistical inference will be presented.","01650270, 1872678X",3.055

We articulate a finite-time, closed-loop controller with an eye toward the physical and mathematical underpinnings of the trade-off between the control time and energy as well as their dependence on the network parameters and structure. The closed-loop controller is tested on a large number of real systems including stem cell differentiation, food webs, random ecosystems, and spiking neuronal networks.

They arise in many situations of physical and biological interests, and they also arise from discretization of nonlinear partial differential equations.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Modeling of deterministic chaotic systems,Physical Review E,"The success of deterministic modeling of a physical system relies on whether the solution of the model would approximate the dynamics of the actual system. When the system is chaotic, situations can arise where periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic set have distinct number of unstable directions and, as a consequence, no model of the system produces reasonably long trajectories that are realized by nature. We argue and present physical examples indicating that, in such a case, though the model is deterministic and low dimensional, statistical quantities can still be reliably computed.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Why are chaotic attractors rare in multistable systems?,Physical Review Letters,"We show that chaotic attractors are rarely found in multistable dissipative systems close to the conservative limit. As we approach this limit, the parameter intervals for the existence of chaotic attractors as well as the volume of their basins of attraction in a bounded region of the state space shrink very rapidly. An important role in the disappearance of these attractors is played by particular points in parameter space, namely, the double crises accompanied by a basin boundary metamorphosis. Scaling relations between successive double crises are presented. Furthermore, along this path of double crises, we obtain scaling laws for the disappearance of chaotic attractors and their basins of attraction.","00319007, 10797114",8.106

We call these numerically obtained orbits “straddle orbits”. By following straddle orbits we can obtain all the basic sets on a basin boundary. Furthermore, we show that knowledge of the basic sets provides essential information on the structure of the boundaries. The straddle orbit method is illustrated by two systems as examples. The first system is a damped driven pendulum which has two basins of attraction separated by a fractal basin boundary. In this case the basic set is chaotic and appears to resemble the product of two Cantor sets.

We show that riddling can be induced by arbitrarily small random noise even if the attractor is transversely unstable, and we obtain universal scaling laws for noise-induced riddling. Our results imply that the phenomenon of riddling can be more prevalent than expected before, as noise is practically inevitable in dynamical systems.","00319007, 10797114",8.106

In particular, we consider the case of nonhyperbolic chaotic scattering, where there exist Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) surfaces in the scattering region. It is found that for short unstable periodic orbits not close to the KAM surfaces, both the probability that a particle can be controlled and the average time to achieve control are determined by the initial exponential decay rate of particles in the hyperbolic component. For periodic orbits near the KAM surfaces, due to the stickiness effect of the KAM surfaces on particle trajectories, the average time to achieve control can greatly exceed that determined by the hyperbolic component.

Furthermore, as the microwave field strength increases, we find that the asymptotic algebraic decay exponent can decrease due to phase-space metamorphoses in which new layers of Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) islands are exposed when KAM surfaces are destroyed. We also find that after such phase-space metamorphoses, the survival probability of an electron as a function of time can have a crossover region with different decay exponents.

Numerous methods have been proposed to fulfill this challenging task, though, the characterization of the fatigue mechanism still, to a large extent, remains to be investigated. To address this problem, we, in this work, develop a novel Multiplex Limited Penetrable Horizontal Visibility Graph (Multiplex LPHVG) method, which allows in not only detecting fatigue driving but also probing into the brain fatigue behavior. Importantly, we use the method to construct brain networks from EEG signals recorded from different subjects performing simulated driving tasks under alert and fatigue driving states. We then employ clustering coefficient, global efficiency and characteristic path length to characterize the topological structure of the networks generated from …","01290657, 17936462",6.117

"Multistability, basin boundary structure, and chaotic behavior in a suspension bridge model",International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"We consider the dynamics of the first vibrational mode of a suspension bridge, resulting from the coupling between its roadbed (elastic beam) and the hangers, supposed to be one-sided springs which respond only to stretching. The external forcing is due to time-periodic vortices produced by impinging wind on the bridge structure. We have studied some relevant dynamical phenomena in such a system, like periodic and quasiperiodic responses, chaotic motion, and boundary crises. In the weak dissipative limit the dynamics is mainly multistable, presenting a variety of coexisting attractors, both periodic and chaotic, with a highly involved basin of attraction structure.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Scaling behavior of transition to chaos in quasiperiodically driven dynamical systems,Physical Review E,"A route to chaos in quasiperiodically driven dynamical systems is investigated whereby the Lyapunov exponent passes through zero linearly near the transition.

The phenomena we study include the double crisis vertex at which an interior and a boundary crisis coincide, and related forms of double crisis.

Exact detection of direct links in networks of interacting dynamical units,New Journal of Physics,"The inference of an underlying network topology from local observations of a complex system composed of interacting units is usually attempted by using statistical similarity measures, such as cross-correlation (CC) and mutual information (MI). The possible existence of a direct link between different units is, however, hindered within the time-series measurements. Here we show that, for the class of systems studied, when an abrupt change in the ordered set of CC or MI values exists, it is possible to infer, without errors, the underlying network topology from the time-series measurements, even in the presence of observational noise, non-identical units, and coupling heterogeneity. We find that a necessary condition for the discontinuity to occur is that the dynamics of the coupled units is partially coherent, ie, neither complete disorder nor globally synchronous patterns are present. We critically compare the inference …",13672630,2.844
Unstable dimension variability in coupled chaotic systems,Physical Review E,"Systems of coupled chaotic maps and flows arise in many situations of physical and biological interest. The aim of this paper is to analyze and to present numerical evidence for a common type of nonhyperbolic behavior in these systems: unstable dimension variability. We show that unstable periodic orbits embedded in the dynamical invariant set of such a system can typically have different numbers of unstable directions. The consequence of this may be severe: the system cannot be modeled deterministically in the sense that no trajectory of the model can be realized by the natural chaotic system that the model is supposed to describe and quantify. We argue that unstable dimension variability can arise for small values of the coupling parameter. Severe modeling difficulties, nonetheless, occur only for reasonable coupling when the unstable dimension variability is appreciable. We speculate about the possible …","24700045, 24700053",2.266

"Chaotic attractors on a 3-torus, and torus break-up",Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Two coupled driven Van der Pol oscillators can have three-frequency quasiperiodic attractors, which lie on a 3-torus. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that the torus is destroyed when the stable and unstable manifolds of an unstable orbit become tangent. Furthermore, no chaotic orbits lying on a torus were observed, suggesting that, in most cases, at least in the case of this system, orbits do not become chaotic before their tori are destroyed. To expedite the calculations, a method was developed, which can be used to determine if an orbit is on a torus, without actually displaying that orbit. The method, also described in this paper, was designed specifically for our system. The basic idea, however, could be used for studying attractors of other systems.

Chaos-based wireless communication resisting multipath effects,Physical Review E,"In additive white Gaussian noise channel, chaos has been shown to be the optimal coherent communication waveform in the sense of using a very simple matched filter to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. Recently, Lyapunov exponent spectrum of the chaotic signals after being transmitted through a wireless channel has been shown to be unaltered, paving the way for wireless communication using chaos. In wireless communication systems, inter-symbol interference caused by multipath propagation is one of the main obstacles to achieve high bit transmission rate and low bit-error rate (BER). How to resist the multipath effect is a fundamental problem in a chaos-based wireless communication system (CWCS).

The change in the shape is accompanied by a change of the bifurcation type along the boundary curves of the phase-locking regions.

Control and applications of chaos,Journal of the Franklin Institute,"This review describes a procedure for stabilizing a desirable chaotic orbit embedded in a chaotic attractor of dissipative dynamical systems by using small feedback control. The key observation is that certain chaotic orbits may correspond to a desirable system performance. By carefully selecting such an orbit, and then applying small feedback control to stabilize a trajectory from a random initial condition around the target chaotic orbit, desirable system performance can be achieved. As applications, three examples are considered: (1) synchronization of chaotic systems; (2) conversion of transient chaos into sustained chaos; and (3) controlling symbolic dynamics for communication. The first and third problems are potentially relevant to communication in engineering, and the solution of the second problem can be applied to electrical power systems to avoid catastrophic event such as the voltage collapse.",00160032,4.072

Erosion of the safe basin for the transversal oscillations of a suspension bridge,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","The time evolution of the lowest order transversal oscillation mode of a suspension bridge is studied by means of a piecewise-linear forced and damped one-dimensional oscillator, in which the loss of smoothness is due to the asymmetric response of the bridge hangers with respect to stretching and compression. If the midpoint roadbed deflection is outside a specified safe region, the bridge is supposed to collapse. We analyze the relative area of the safe basin, or the fraction of initial conditions in the phase space for which the bridge does not collapse with respect to the damping and forcing parameters.

Then, a multiattention convolutional neural network is employed to extract deep representation from raw EEG signals. Especially, a domain discriminator is applied to deep representation to reduce the differences between sessions for target subjects.

Universal formalism of Fano resonance,AIP Advances,"The phenomenon of Fano resonance is ubiquitous in a large variety of wave scattering systems, where the resonance profile is typically asymmetric. Whether the parameter characterizing the asymmetry should be complex or real is an issue of great experimental interest. Using coherent quantum transport as a paradigm and taking into account of the collective contribution from all available scattering channels, we derive a universal formula for the Fano-resonance profile. We show that our formula bridges naturally the traditional Fano formulas with complex and real asymmetry parameters, indicating that the two types of formulas are fundamentally equivalent (except for an offset). The connection also reveals a clear footprint for the conductance resonance during a dephasing process. Therefore, the emergence of complex asymmetric parameter when fitting with experimental data needs to be properly interpreted …",21583226,1.45
A systems biology analysis of long and short-term memories of osmotic stress adaptation in fungi,BMC research notes,"Background
Saccharomyces cerevisiae senses hyperosmotic conditions via the HOG signaling network that activates the stress-activated protein kinase, Hog1, and modulates metabolic fluxes and gene expression to generate appropriate adaptive responses. The integral control mechanism by which Hog1 modulates glycerol production remains uncharacterized. An additional Hog1-independent mechanism retains intracellular glycerol for adaptation. Candida albicans also adapts to hyperosmolarity via a HOG signaling network. However, it remains unknown whether Hog1 exerts integral or proportional control over glycerol production in C. albicans.

We combined modeling and experimental approaches to study osmotic stress responses in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. We propose a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) model that …",17560500,1.744
Structure and crises of fractal basin boundaries,Physics Letters A,"Basin boundaries for dynamical systems with coexisting attractors can be smooth or fractal. An understanding of fractal boundaries may be important for a number of physically significant reasons [1, 2](eg, they affect the degree to which final states can be predicted in situations where error is present in the specification of initial conditions). Until recently [1-5], however, studies focusing on the properties of fractal basin boundaries have been primarily restricted to mappings of a single complex variable, z~ F (z), where z-x+ iy and F is an analytic function (henceforth referred to as analytic maps). In this case the formalism of analytic function theory can be applied, and many beautiful results have been obtained [6], dating back to the classic work of Julia and Fatou at the beginning of this century. We note, however, that analytic maps represent a very restricted class of twodimensional mappings (eg, due to the Cauchy-Riemann conditions they cannot possess chaotic attractors). The work reported in this letter was initially motivated by the desire to see whether the properties of fractal basin boundaries of analytic maps extend to basin boundaries of more general mappings of the plane (such as those that might arise from a surface of section for systems of ordinary differential equations). In addition, we shall also describe a new type of boundary crisis [7](in a boundary crisis, a","00036951, 10773118",3.462
Tipping point and noise-induced transients in ecological networks,Journal of the Royal Society Interface,"A challenging and outstanding problem in interdisciplinary research is to understand the interplay between transients and stochasticity in high-dimensional dynamical systems. Focusing on the tipping-point dynamics in complex mutualistic networks in ecology constructed from empirical data, we investigate the phenomena of noise-induced collapse and noise-induced recovery. Two types of noise are studied: environmental (Gaussian white) noise and state-dependent demographic noise. The dynamical mechanism responsible for both phenomena is a transition from one stable steady state to another driven by stochastic forcing, mediated by an unstable steady state. Exploiting a generic and effective two-dimensional reduced model for real-world mutualistic networks, we find that the average transient lifetime scales algebraically with the noise amplitude, for both environmental and demographic noise. We develop …","17425662, 17425689",3.733
Pseudo-deterministic chaotic systems,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"We call a chaotic dynamical system pseudo-deterministic when it does not produce numerical, or pseudo-trajectories that stay close, or shadow chaotic true trajectories, even though the model equations are strictly deterministic. In this case, single chaotic trajectories may not be meaningful, and only statistical predictions, at best, could be drawn on the model, like in a stochastic system. The dynamical reason for this behavior is nonhyperbolicity characterized either by tangencies of stable and unstable manifolds or by the presence of periodic orbits embedded in a chaotic invariant set with a different number of unstable directions. We emphasize herewith the latter by studying a low-dimensional discrete-time model in which the phenomenon appears due to a saddle-repeller bifurcation. We also investigate the behavior of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents for the system, which quantifies this type of nonhyperbolicity …","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Riddling of chaotic sets in periodic windows,Physical Review Letters,"Previous investigations of riddling have focused on the case where the dynamical invariant set in the symmetric invariant manifold of the system is a chaotic attractor. A situation expected to arise commonly in physical systems, however, is that the dynamics in the invariant manifold is in a periodic window. We argue and demonstrate that riddling can be more pervasive in this case because it can occur regardless of whether the chaotic set in the invariant manifold is transversly stable or unstable. Scaling behavior associated with this type of riddling is analyzed and is supported by numerical experiments.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Basin bifurcation in quasiperiodically forced systems,Physical Review E,"In this paper we study quasiperiodically forced systems exhibiting fractal and Wada basin boundaries. Specifically, by utilizing a class of representative systems, we analyze the dynamical origin of such basin boundaries and we characterize them. Furthermore, we find that basin boundaries in a quasiperiodically driven system can undergo a unique type of bifurcation in which isolated “islands” of basins of attraction are created as a system parameter changes. The mechanism for this type of basin boundary bifurcation is elucidated.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Emergence of transient chaos and intermittency in machine learning,Journal of Physics: Complexity,"An emerging paradigm for predicting the state evolution of chaotic systems is machine learning with reservoir computing, the core of which is a dynamical network of artificial neurons. Through training with measured time series, a reservoir machine can be harnessed to replicate the evolution of the target chaotic system for some amount of time, typically about half dozen Lyapunov times. Recently, we developed a reservoir computing framework with an additional parameter channel for predicting system collapse and chaotic transients associated with crisis. It was found that the crisis point after which transient chaos emerges can be accurately predicted. The idea of adding a parameter channel to reservoir computing has also been used by others to predict bifurcation points and distinct asymptotic behaviors. In this paper, we address three issues associated with machine-generated transient chaos. First, we report the …",2632072X,2.72
Tumour chemotherapy strategy based on impulse control theory,"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","Chemotherapy is a widely accepted method for tumour treatment. A medical doctor usually treats patients periodically with an amount of drug according to empirical medicine guides. From the point of view of cybernetics, this procedure is an impulse control system, where the amount and frequency of drug used can be determined analytically using the impulse control theory. In this paper, the stability of a chemotherapy treatment of a tumour is analysed applying the impulse control theory. The globally stable condition for prescription of a periodic oscillatory chemotherapeutic agent is derived. The permanence of the solution of the treatment process is verified using the Lyapunov function and the comparison theorem.

From START to FINISH: the influence of osmotic stress on the cell cycle,PLoS One,"The cell cycle is a sequence of biochemical events that are controlled by complex but robust molecular machinery. This enables cells to achieve accurate self-reproduction under a broad range of different conditions. Environmental changes are transmitted by molecular signalling networks, which coordinate their action with the cell cycle. The cell cycle process and its responses to environmental stresses arise from intertwined nonlinear interactions among large numbers of simpler components. Yet, understanding of how these pieces fit together into a coherent whole requires a systems biology approach. Here, we present a novel mathematical model that describes the influence of osmotic stress on the entire cell cycle of S. cerevisiae for the first time. Our model incorporates all recently known and several proposed interactions between the osmotic stress response pathway and the cell cycle. This model unveils the mechanisms that emerge as a consequence of the interaction between the cell cycle and stress response networks. Furthermore, it characterises the role of individual components. Moreover, it predicts different phenotypical responses for cells depending on the phase of cells at the onset of the stress. The key predictions of the model are: (i) exposure of cells to osmotic stress during the late S and the early G2/M phase can induce DNA re-replication before cell division occurs, (ii) cells stressed at the late G2/M phase display accelerated exit from mitosis and arrest in the next cell cycle, (iii) osmotic stress delays the G1-to-S and G2-to-M transitions in a dose dependent manner, whereas it accelerates the M-to-G1 transition independently of …",19326203,3.107
Escaping from nonhyperbolic chaotic attractors,Physical Review Letters,"The noise-induced escape process from a nonhyperbolic chaotic attractor is of physical and fundamental importance. We address this problem by uncovering the general mechanism of escape in the relevant low noise limit using the Hamiltonian theory of large fluctuations and by establishing the crucial role of the primary homoclinic tangency closest to the basin boundary in the dynamical process. In order to demonstrate that, we provide an unambiguous solution of the variational equations from the Hamiltonian theory. Our results are substantiated with the help of physical and dynamical paradigms, such as the Hénon and the Ikeda maps. It is further pointed out that our findings should be valid for driven flow systems and for experimental data.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Reactive particles in random flows,Physical Review Letters,"We study the dynamics of chemically or biologically active particles advected by open flows of chaotic time dependence, which can be modeled by a random time dependence of the parameters on a stroboscopic map. We develop a general theory for reactions in such random flows, and derive the reaction equation for this case. We show that there is a singular enhancement of the reaction in random flows, and this enhancement is increased as compared to the nonrandom case. We verify our theory in a model flow generated by four point vortices moving chaotically.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Strange nonchaotic attractors in a nonsmooth dynamical system,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"Strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) have fractal geometric structure, but are nonchaotic in the dynamical sense. Since Grebogi et al. discovered SNA in 1984, it has become one of the important topics in nonlinear dynamics. Now, the study of SNAs has been mainly confined to smooth dynamics with quasiperiodic excitation or random excitation. In this paper, we consider a class of single-degree-of-freedom gear dynamical system with quasiperiodic forcing. We show that the gear transmission system can be modeled as a three-dimensional piecewise linear system, which belongs to a typical class of nonsmooth system. We then show that SNAs do exist in such nonsmooth dynamical system with quasiperiodic force. The dynamical behavior of the nonsmooth system is analyzed as a parameter is varied.

Exploiting the natural redundancy of chaotic signals in communication systems,Physical Review Letters,Chaotic signals can be used as carriers of information in communication systems. In this work we describe a simple encoding method that allows one to map any desired bit sequence into a chaotic waveform. The redundancy of the resulting information carrying signal enables us to devise a novel signal reconstruction technique that is able to recover relatively large parts of the chaotic signal starting from just a few samples of it. We show that this technique allows one to increase both the transmission reliability and the transmission rate of a communication system even in the presence of noise.,"00319007, 10797114",8.106
Simplicial approximation of Poincaré maps of differential equations,Physics Letters A,A method is proposed to transform a nonlinear differential system into a map without having to integrate the whole orbit as in the usual Poincaré return map technique. It consists of constructing a piecewise linear map by coarse-graining the phase surface of section into simplices and using the Poincaré return map values at the vertices to define a linear map on each simplex. The numerical results show that the simplicial map is a good approximation to the Poincaré map and it leads to a factor of 20 to 40 savings in computer time as compared with the integration of the differential equation. Computation of the generalized information dimensions of a chaotic orbit for the simplicial map gives values in close agreement with those found for the Poincaré map.,"00036951, 10773118",3.462
Characterizing riddled fractal sets,Physical Review E,"Recent studies have revealed that riddled fractal sets, sets whose conventionally defined fractal dimensions are integers, occur commonly in chaotic dynamical systems.

Multilayer brain network combined with deep convolutional neural network for detecting major depressive disorder,Nonlinear Dynamics,"As a global and grievous mental disease, major depressive disorder (MDD) has received much attention. Accurate detection of MDD via physiological signals represents an urgent research topic.

Multivariate pseudo Wigner distribution is firstly introduced to extract the time-frequency characteristics from the multi-channel EEG signals. Then multilayer brain network is constructed, with each layer corresponding to a specific frequency band. Such multilayer framework is in line with the nature of the workings of the brain, and can effectively characterize the brain state. Further, a multilayer deep CNN architecture is designed to study the brain network topology features, which is finally used to accurately detect MDD.

Mutual information rate and bounds for it,PLoS One,"The amount of information exchanged per unit of time between two nodes in a dynamical network or between two data sets is a powerful concept for analysing complex systems. This quantity, known as the mutual information rate (MIR), is calculated from the mutual information, which is rigorously defined only for random systems. Moreover, the definition of mutual information is based on probabilities of significant events. This work offers a simple alternative way to calculate the MIR in dynamical (deterministic) networks or between two time series (not fully deterministic), and to calculate its upper and lower bounds without having to calculate probabilities, but rather in terms of well known and well defined quantities in dynamical systems. As possible applications of our bounds, we study the relationship between synchronisation and the exchange of information in a system of two coupled maps and in experimental networks of coupled oscillators.",19326203,3.107
Limited resources in a driven diffusion process,Physical Review Letters,"The advance of particles in many driven diffusion systems depends on the availability of resources in the surrounding environment. In the balance between supply and demand of such resources we are confronted with a regime in which, under limited resource availability, the flow is markedly reduced. In the context of mRNA translation this represents the finite availability of amino acid-tRNA molecules. In this limited resources regime a severe depletion of amino acid tRNAs is also observed. These dramatic effects are vital to our understanding of translation, and are likely to also be important for the many other applications of driven diffusion models.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Topology of high-dimensional chaotic scattering,Physical Review E,"We investigate Hamiltonian chaotic scattering in physically realistic three-dimensional potentials. We find that the basin topology of the scattering dynamics can undergo a metamorphosis from being totally disconnected to being connected as a system parameter, such as the particle energy, is varied through a critical value. The dynamical origin of the metamorphosis is investigated, and the topological change in the scattering basin is explained in terms of the change in the structure of the invariant set of nonescaping orbits. A dynamical consequence of this metamorphosis is that the fractal dimension of the chaotic set responsible for the chaotic scattering changes its behavior characteristically at the metamorphosis. This topological metamorphosis has no correspondence in two-degree-of-freedom open Hamiltonian systems.","24700045, 24700053",2.266

Complexity in Hamiltonian-driven dissipative chaotic dynamical systems,Physical Review E,"The existence of symmetry in chaotic dynamical systems often leads to one or several low-dimensional invariant subspaces in the phase space. We demonstrate that complex behaviors can arise when the dynamics in the invariant subspace is Hamiltonian but the full system is dissipative. In particular, an infinite number of distinct attractors can coexist. These attractors can be quasiperiodic, strange nonchaotic, and chaotic with different positive Lyapunov exponents. Finite perturbations in initial conditions or parameters can lead to a change from nonchaotic attractors to chaotic attractors. However, arbitrarily small perturbations can lead to dynamically distinct chaotic attractors. This work demonstrates that the interplay between conservative and dissipative dynamics can give rise to rich complexity even in physical systems with a few degrees of freedom.© 1996 The American Physical Society.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Experimental phase separation differential chaos shift keying wireless communication based on matched filter,IEEE Access,"New findings have been identified recently for chaos application in communication systems, including the simplest matched filter to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the ability to resist multi-path propagation. However, chaos has a broad band frequency spectrum, which impedes its application in the conventional wireless communication systems due to the antenna and transducer bandwidth. To deal with such problem, the chaos generated by a second order hybrid system (SOHS) with a fixed basis function is used for Differential Chaos Shift Keying (DCSK) communication. A sinusoidal and its orthogonal signal are used to separate the reference signal and the information bearing signal, which are transmitted in the wireless channel. In such a way, the obstacle to broadband signal transmission in a wireless channel is overcome. A matched filter, using the convolution of the received signal and the time …",21693536,4.644
Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics in graphene billiards with the shape of classically integrable billiards,Physical Review E,"A crucial result in quantum chaos, which has been established for a long time, is that the spectral properties of classically integrable systems generically are described by Poisson statistics, whereas those of time-reversal symmetric, classically chaotic systems coincide with those of random matrices from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). Does this result hold for two-dimensional Dirac material systems? To address this fundamental question, we investigate the spectral properties in a representative class of graphene billiards with shapes of classically integrable circular-sector billiards. Naively one may expect to observe Poisson statistics, which is indeed true for energies close to the band edges where the quasiparticle obeys the Schrödinger equation. However, for energies near the Dirac point, where the quasiparticles behave like massless Dirac fermions, Poisson statistics is extremely rare in the sense …","24700045, 24700053",2.266
"Fractality, chaos, and reactions in imperfectly mixed open hydrodynamical flows",Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"We investigate the dynamics of tracer particles in time-dependent open flows. If the advection is passive the tracer dynamics is shown to be typically transiently chaotic. This implies the appearance of stable fractal patterns, so-called unstable manifolds, traced out by ensembles of particles. Next, the advection of chemically or biologically active tracers is investigated. Since the tracers spend a long time in the vicinity of a fractal curve, the unstable manifold, this fractal structure serves as a catalyst for the active process. The permanent competition between the enhanced activity along the unstable manifold and the escape due to advection results in a steady state of constant production rate. This observation provides a possible solution for the so-called “paradox of plankton”, that several competing plankton species are able to coexists in spite of the competitive exclusion predicted by classical studies.

Crisis and enhancement of chaotic scattering,Physical Review E,"Chaotic scattering is characterized by the existence of nonattracting chaotic invariant sets in phase space. There can be several chaotic invariant sets coexisting in phase space when a system parameter value is below some critical value. As the parameter changes through the critical value, stable and unstable foliations of these chaotic invariant sets, which are fractal sets, can become tangent and then cross each other. The first tangency, which provides the linking between chaotic invariant sets, is a crisis in chaotic scattering. Above the crisis, there is an infinite number of such tangencies which keep occurring until the last tangency, above which the stable and unstable foliations cross transversely. As a consequence of this, the fractal dimension of the set of singularities in the scattering function increases in the parameter range determined by the first and the last tangencies.

One increasingly used approach to identify causal connectivity uses the concept of Granger causality that exploits predictability of activity in one region by past activity in other regions of the brain. Owing to the complexity of the data, selecting components for the analysis of causality as a preprocessing step has to be performed. This includes predetermined—and often arbitrary—exclusion of information. Therefore, the system is confounded by latent sources.

Crisis control: Preventing chaos-induced capsizing of a ship,Physical Review E,"Responses of many man-made systems, such as ships or oil-drilling platforms, when subject to irregularly time varying environments, can be described by irregularly driven dynamical systems. Consequently, failures of such systems (eg, capsize of a ship or collapse of a platform), under increasingly severe environmental conditions, come about when the system state escapes from a destroyed chaotic attractor located in some favorable region of the phase space. In this paper we propose a control strategy, based on a previous method of chaos control, which can prevent such failures from taking place. The key feature of our strategy is the incorporation of prediction of the evolution of the environment. This makes possible effective operation of the control even when the temporal behavior of the environment has substantial irregularity. We illustrate the ideas using ship capsizing as an example.","24700045, 24700053",2.266

Using non-chaotic Chen system as an example, we prove by analytical and numerical methods that chaos is indeed generated. The features of the chaos generated by impulse control are analysed using Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation diagram, power spectrum, Poincaré mapping and Kaplan-Yorke dimension.

Rate-dependent bifurcation dodging in a thermoacoustic system driven by colored noise,Nonlinear Dynamics,"Tipping in multistable systems occurs usually by varying the input slightly, resulting in the output switching to an often unsatisfactory state. This phenomenon is manifested in thermoacoustic systems. The thermoacoustic instability may lead to the disintegration of rocket engines, gas turbines and aeroengines, so it is necessary to design control measures for its suppression. It was speculated that such unwanted instability states may be dodged by changing the bifurcation parameters quickly enough, and compared with the white noise discussed in [1], colored noise with nonzero correlation time is more practical and important to the system. Thus, in this work, based on a fundamental mathematical model of thermoacoustic systems driven by colored noise, the corresponding Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov equation of the amplitude is derived by using a stochastic averaging method.

A matter of life or death: modeling DNA damage and repair in bacteria,Biophysical Journal,"DNA damage is a hazard all cells must face, and evolution has created a number of mechanisms to repair damaged bases in the chromosome.

Fractal structures in stenoses and aneurysms in blood vessels,"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","Recent advances in the field of chaotic advection provide the impetus to revisit the dynamics of particles transported by blood flow in the presence of vessel wall irregularities. The irregularity, being either a narrowing or expansion of the vessel, mimicking stenoses or aneurysms, generates abnormal flow patterns that lead to a peculiar filamentary distribution of advected particles, which, in the blood, would include platelets. Using a simple model, we show how the filamentary distribution depends on the size of the vessel wall irregularity, and how it varies under resting or exercise conditions. The particles transported by blood flow that spend a long time around a disturbance either stick to the vessel wall or reside on fractal filaments. We show that the faster flow associated with exercise creates widespread filaments where particles can get trapped for a longer time, thus allowing for the possible activation of such …","1364503X, 14712962",4.253

Collective almost synchronisation in complex networks,PloS one,"This work introduces the phenomenon of Collective Almost Synchronisation (CAS), which describes a universal way of how patterns can appear in complex networks for small coupling strengths. The CAS phenomenon appears due to the existence of an approximately constant local mean field and is characterised by having nodes with trajectories evolving around periodic stable orbits. Common notion based on statistical knowledge would lead one to interpret the appearance of a local constant mean field as a consequence of the fact that the behaviour of each node is not correlated to the behaviours of the others. Contrary to this common notion, we show that various well known weaker forms of synchronisation (almost, time-lag, phase synchronisation, and generalised synchronisation) appear as a result of the onset of an almost constant local mean field. If the memory is formed in a brain by minimising the coupling strength among neurons and maximising the number of possible patterns, then the CAS phenomenon is a plausible explanation for it.",19326203,3.107

Unexpected robustness against noise of a class of nonhyperbolic chaotic attractors,Physical Review E,"Chaotic attractors arising in physical systems are often nonhyperbolic. We compare two sources of nonhyperbolicity:(1) tangencies between stable and unstable manifolds, and (2) unstable dimension variability. We study the effects of noise on chaotic attractors with these nonhyperbolic behaviors by investigating the scaling laws for the Hausdorff distance between the noisy and the deterministic attractors. Whereas in the presence of tangencies, interactive noise yields attractor deformations, attractors with only dimension variability are robust, despite the fact that shadowing is grossly violated.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Weak connections form an infinite number of patterns in the brain,Scientific Reports,"Recently, much attention has been paid to interpreting the mechanisms for memory formation in terms of brain connectivity and dynamics. Within the plethora of collective states a complex network can exhibit, we show that the phenomenon of Collective Almost Synchronisation (CAS), which describes a state with an infinite number of patterns emerging in complex networks for weak coupling strengths, deserves special attention. We show that a simulated neuron network with neurons weakly connected does produce CAS patterns, and additionally produces an output that optimally model experimental electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. This work provides strong evidence that the brain operates locally in a CAS regime, allowing it to have an unlimited number of dynamical patterns, a state that could explain the enormous memory capacity of the brain, and that would give support to the idea that local clusters of …",20452322,3.883
Transient chaos-a resolution of breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence in optomechanics,Scientific reports,"Recently, the phenomenon of quantum-classical correspondence breakdown was uncovered in optomechanics, where in the classical regime the system exhibits chaos but in the corresponding quantum regime the motion is regular - there appears to be no signature of classical chaos whatsoever in the corresponding quantum system, generating a paradox. We find that transient chaos, besides being a physically meaningful phenomenon by itself, provides a resolution. Using the method of quantum state diffusion to simulate the system dynamics subject to continuous homodyne detection, we uncover transient chaos associated with quantum trajectories. The transient behavior is consistent with chaos in the classical limit, while the long term evolution of the quantum system is regular. Transient chaos thus serves as a bridge for the quantum-classical transition (QCT). Strikingly, as the system transitions from the …",20452322,3.883

Multistability in a quasiperiodically forced piecewise smooth dynamical system,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"Considering a class of quasiperiodically forced piecewise smooth systems, we uncover a dynamic phenomenon in which strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) and quasiperiodic attractors coexist in nonsmooth dynamical system, obtaining the domains of attraction of these coexisting attractors in parameter space in order to analyze the global dynamics. The global dynamics analysis demonstrates that SNAs are the transition from quasiperiodic attractors to chaotic attractors. The routes to SNAs, including torus-doubling route, torus fractalization route or, simply, fractal route, and intermittency route, are also investigated. The characteristics of SNAs are described by dynamical invariants such as the Lyapunov exponent, power spectrum, phase sensitivity and rational approximations.",10075704,3.864
Superpersistent currents and whispering gallery modes in relativistic quantum chaotic systems,Scientific reports,"Persistent currents (PCs), one of the most intriguing manifestations of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect, are known to vanish for Schrödinger particles in the presence of random scatterings, e.g., due to classical chaos. But would this still be the case for Dirac fermions? Addressing this question is of significant value due to the tremendous recent interest in two-dimensional Dirac materials. We investigate relativistic quantum AB rings threaded by a magnetic flux and find that PCs are extremely robust. Even for highly asymmetric rings that host fully developed classical chaos, the amplitudes of PCs are of the same order of magnitude as those for integrable rings, henceforth the term superpersistent currents (SPCs). A striking finding is that the SPCs can be attributed to a robust type of relativistic quantum states, i.e., Dirac whispering gallery modes (WGMs) that carry large angular momenta and travel along the boundaries …",20452322,3.883

Conductance fluctuations in graphene systems: The relevance of classical dynamics,Physical Review B—Condensed Matter and Materials Physics,"Conductance fluctuations associated with transport through quantum-dot systems are currently understood to depend on the nature of the corresponding classical dynamics, i.e., integrable or chaotic. However, we find that in graphene quantum-dot systems, when a magnetic field is present, signatures of classical dynamics can disappear and universal scaling behaviors emerge. In particular, as the Fermi energy or the magnetic flux is varied, both regular oscillations and random fluctuations in the conductance can occur, with alternating transitions between the two. By carrying out a detailed analysis of two types of integrable (hexagonal and square) and one type of chaotic (stadium) graphene dot system, we uncover a universal scaling law among the critical Fermi energy, the critical magnetic flux, and the dot size.

We find that electrons tend to take on propagating paths due to Klein tunneling that have absolutely no counterpart in nonrelativistic quantum systems. Strikingly, such abnormal quantum paths can lead to an extreme type of fractal-like of conductance fluctuations, not seen previously in any quantum transport systems.

Furthermore, we quantify the typical length scale of the clusters obtained by 3D simulations using the index of dispersion, a measure for the deviation of the particle density from a Poissonian. We then derive an expression for the expected length scales of cluster formation from a stability analysis in the hydrodynamical approximation. We find a good agreement between our theoretical prediction and numerical experiments.","00319007, 10797114",8.106

Specifically, the preprocessed EEG signals from source and target domain are mapped into latent space with an embedding module, where the representation distributions and label distributions across domains have a large discrepancy. We assume that there exists a non-linear coupling matrix between both domains, which can be utilized to estimate the distance of joint distributions for different domains. Depending on the optimal transport, the Wasserstein distance between source and target domains is minimized, yielding the alignment of joint distributions.

Reconstructing direct and indirect interactions in networked public goods game,Scientific Reports,"Network reconstruction is a fundamental problem for understanding many complex systems with unknown interaction structures. In many complex systems, there are indirect interactions between two individuals without immediate connection but with common neighbors. Despite recent advances in network reconstruction, we continue to lack an approach for reconstructing complex networks with indirect interactions. Here we introduce a two-step strategy to resolve the reconstruction problem, where in the first step, we recover both direct and indirect interactions by employing the Lasso to solve a sparse signal reconstruction problem, and in the second step, we use matrix transformation and optimization to distinguish between direct and indirect interactions. The network structure corresponding to direct interactions can be fully uncovered. We exploit the public goods game occurring on complex networks as a …",20452322,3.883
Driving trajectories in chaotic systems,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"This work presents the main ideas and the fundamental procedures for guiding trajectories on chaotic systems and for stabilizing chaotic orbits, all with the use of small perturbations. We consider an extension of the Ott–Grebogi–Yorke method of controlling chaos and an associated procedure for guiding trajectories on chaotic sets of high dimensional systems. We argue that those techniques can be used even if the chaotic invariant set is nonattractive. As nonattractive chaotic invariant sets commonly exist embedded in high dimensional systems, we also argue that we can combine chaotic control techniques with system control strategies to generate a powerful mechanism for manipulating the dynamics. We present an example in which we change and alter system's evolution at will using only small perturbations to some accessible parameter.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Massive bifurcation of chaotic scattering,Physics Letters A,"In this paper we investigate a new type of bifurcation which occurs in the context of chaotic scattering. The phenomenology of this bifurcation is that the scattering is chaotic on both sides of the bifurcation, but, as the system parameter passes through the critical value, an infinite number of periodic orbits are destroyed and replaced by a new infinite class of periodic orbits. Hence the structure of the chaotic set is fundamentally altered by the bifurcation. The symbolic dynamics before and after the bifurcation, however, remains unchanged.","00036951, 10773118",3.462

Riddled basins and unstable dimension variability in chaotic systems with and without symmetry,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Riddling occurs in dissipative dynamical systems with more than one attractor, when the basin of one attractor is punctured with holes belonging to the basins of the other attractors. The basin of a chaotic attractor is riddled if (i) it has a positive Lebesgue measure; (ii) in the vicinity of every point belonging to the basin of the attractor, there is a positive Lebesgue measure set of points that asymptote to another attractor. We investigate the presence of riddled basins in a two-dimensional noninvertible map with a symmetry-breaking term. In the symmetric case the onset of riddling is characterized by an unstable–unstable pair bifurcation, which also leads to unstable dimension variability in the invariant chaotic set. The nonsymmetric case exhibits a chaotic attractor, but a riddled basin occurs only at the bifurcation point, since after that the attractor becomes a chaotic saddle.

Message transmission is performed by means of codeword, ie, specific targeting instructions are sent to the receiver rather than the explicit message. This approach yields (i) error correction availability for transmission in the presence of noise or dropouts,(ii) transmission in a compressed format,(iii) a high level of security against undesirable detection, and (iv) language recognition.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Universal behavior in the parametric evolution of chaotic saddles,Physical Review E,"Chaotic saddles are nonattracting dynamical invariant sets that physically lead to transient chaos. As a system parameter changes, chaotic saddles can evolve via an infinite number of homoclinic or heteroclinic tangencies of their stable and unstable manifolds. Based on previous numerical evidence and a rigorous analysis of a class of representative models, we show that dynamical invariants such as the topological entropy and the fractal dimension of chaotic saddles obey a universal behavior: they exhibit a devil-staircase characteristic as a function of the system parameter.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Chaotic scattering in time-dependent Hamiltonian systems,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"We consider the classical scattering of particles in a one-degree-of-freedom, time-dependent Hamiltonian system. We demonstrate that chaotic scattering can be induced by periodic oscillations in the position of the potential. We study the invariant sets on a surface of section for different amplitudes of the oscillating potential. It is found that for small amplitudes, the phase space consists of nonescaping KAM islands and an escaping set. The escaping set is made up of a nonhyperbolic set that gives rise to chaotic scattering and remains of KAM islands. For large amplitudes, the phase space contains a Lebesgue measure zero invariant set that gives rise to chaotic scattering. In this regime, we also discuss the physical origin of the Cantor set responsible for the chaotic scattering and calculate its fractal dimension.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Scaling of fractal basin boundaries near intermittency transitions to chaos,Physical Review A,"It is the purpose of this paper to point out that the creation of fractal basin boundaries is a characteristic feature accompanying the intermittency transition to chaos.(Here ‘‘intermittency’’transition is used in the sense of Pomeau and Manneville [Commun.

We examine the scaling of the dimension of basin boundaries near these intermittency transitions. We find, from numerical experiments, that near the transition the dimension scales with a system parameter p according to the power law d≃ d 0-k‖ p-p I‖ β with β=(1/2, where d 0 is the dimension at the intermittency transition parameter value p= p I and k is a scaling constant.

Self-adaptation of chimera states,Physical Review E,"Chimera states in spatiotemporal dynamical systems have been investigated in physical, chemical, and biological systems, and have been shown to be robust against random perturbations. How do chimera states achieve their robustness? We uncover a self-adaptation behavior by which, upon a spatially localized perturbation, the coherent component of the chimera state spontaneously drifts to an optimal location as far away from the perturbation as possible, exposing only its incoherent component to the perturbation to minimize the disturbance. A systematic numerical analysis of the evolution of the spatiotemporal pattern of the chimera state towards the optimal stable state reveals an exponential relaxation process independent of the spatial location of the perturbation, implying that its effects can be modeled as restoring and damping forces in a mechanical system and enabling the articulation of a …","24700045, 24700053",2.266

Poincaré recurrence and measure of hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic chaotic attractors,Physical Review Letters,"We study Poincaré recurrence of chaotic attractors for regions of finite size. Contrary to the standard case, where the size of the recurrent regions tends to zero, the measure is no longer supported solely by unstable periodic orbits of finite length inside it, but also by other special recurrent trajectories, located outside that region. The presence of the latter leads to a deviation of the distribution of the Poincaré first return times from a Poissonian. Consequently, by taking into account the contribution of these special recurrent trajectories, a corrected estimate of the measure is obtained. This has wide experimental implications, as in the laboratory all returns can exclusively be observed for regions of finite size, and only unstable periodic orbits of finite length can be detected.","00319007, 10797114",8.106

Critical exponents for power-spectra scaling at mergings of chaotic bands,Physical Review A,"The properties of the power spectra of a broad class of smooth d-dimensional (d≥ 2) dynamical systems exhibiting a reverse sequence of pairwise mergings of chaotic bands is discussed.

Numerical experiments are performed which verify theoretical predictions for γ. For example, near the accumulation of period doublings the result for the critical exponent reduces to γ=(1/2+ 2− m η/ln (1/J), where η is a universal number, J is the Jacobian determinant, and 2 m is the number of bands (before merging).(In the trivial case of smooth one-dimensional maps J→ 0 and the exponent is (1/2.).

Strange nonchaotic attractors and multistability in a two-degree-of-freedom quasiperiodically forced vibro-impact system,Fractals,"In this work, we initially study the strange nonchaotic dynamics of a two-degree-of-freedom quasiperiodically forced vibro-impact system. It is shown that strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) occur between two chaotic regions, but not between the quasiperiodic region and the chaotic one. Subsequently, we mainly focus on the abundant multistability in the system, especially the coexistence of SNAs and quasiperiodic attractors. Besides, the coexistence of quasiperiodic attractors of different frequencies, and the coexistence of quasiperiodic attractors and chaotic attractors are also uncovered. The basins of attraction of these coexisting attractors are obtained.

At the same time, the symbol judgment threshold determined by the chaos properties is used to reduce the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) effect. Simulations and virtual channel experiments show that the radio-wave communication system using chaos is inferior to the conventional radio-wave communication system using Square Root Raised Cosine (SRRC) shape-forming filter in a single path channel.

Noise-enabled species recovery in the aftermath of a tipping point,Physical Review E,"The beneficial role of noise in promoting species coexistence and preventing extinction has been recognized in theoretical ecology, but previous studies were mostly concerned with low-dimensional systems. We investigate the interplay between noise and nonlinear dynamics in real-world complex mutualistic networks with a focus on species recovery in the aftermath of a tipping point. Particularly, as a critical parameter such as the mutualistic interaction strength passes through a tipping point, the system collapses and approaches an extinction state through a dramatic reduction in the species populations to near-zero values. We demonstrate the striking effect of noise: when the direction of parameter change is reversed through the tipping point, noise enables species recovery which otherwise would not be possible.

We show that the occurrence of one or the other type of boundary is determined by the topology of the accessible configuration space, and also by the chosen definition of escapes.

Chaotic attractor of the normal form map for grazing bifurcations of impact oscillators,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Grazing bifurcations can cause impact oscillators to exhibit chaotic motions. Such dynamical behaviour can be described by a normal form map (called the Nordmark map). A main feature of the Nordmark map is that it has a square-root term. The purpose of this paper is to study the structure of the chaotic attractor of the Nordmark map from the topological point of view. First, the trapping region of the asymptotic dynamics of the map is constructed. It is then proven that, for some set of parameter values having positive Lebesgue measure, the ω-limit set of each point of the trapping region is contained in a invariant set which is just the closure of the unstable manifold of the hyperbolic fixed point of the map. Besides, the dynamics on the invariant set is topologically mixing. Accordingly the invariant set is a chaotic attractor of the map.",01672789,3.117
Existence of chaos in the Chen system with linear time-delay feedback,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"It is mathematically challenging to analytically show that complex dynamical phenomena observed in simulations and experiments are truly chaotic.

The fractal dimension of the chaotic saddle increases abruptly through the bifurcation. We illustrate our finding by using a system of coupled maps.","00036951, 10773118",3.462

Predicting extreme events from data using deep machine learning: When and where,Physical Review Research,"We develop a framework based on the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for model-free prediction of the occurrence of extreme events both in time (“when”) and in space (“where”) in nonlinear physical systems of spatial dimension two. The measurements or data are a set of two-dimensional snapshots or images. For a desired time horizon of prediction, a proper labeling scheme can be designated to enable successful training of the DCNN and subsequent prediction of extreme events in time. Given that an extreme event has been predicted to occur within the time horizon, a space-based labeling scheme can be applied to predict, within certain resolution, the location at which the event will occur. We use synthetic data from the two-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and empirical wind speed data from the North Atlantic Ocean to demonstrate and validate our machine-learning-based …",26431564,3.772
One-way hash function based on delay-induced hyperchaos,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"A scheme for constructing one-way Hash function based on hyperchaos induced by time delay and key-stream function iteration is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the plaintext and secret key are used as the initial value in two hyperchaotic Chen systems; these values are evolved in a hyperchaotic way during a predefined period. The results of the evolution are quantified and iterated using key-stream function iteration to confuse and diffuse the plaintext and secret key. The cipher block chaining mode is used to generate a 128 bits Hash value for a plaintext of arbitrary length. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm has satisfactory performance, such as value compression function, irreversibility, initial value sensitivity, forgery resistance and collision resistance.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Uncovering missing symbols in communication with filtered chaotic signals,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"We investigate the physical modifications caused by a linear filter in a chaotic trajectory. We show that while the filter strongly modifies the topological characteristics of the chaotic signal, it might not alter its information content. We propose a chaos-based communication system that takes advantage of this fundamental characteristic of the dynamics. We devise procedures both to recover all the symbols at the receiver end and to decode the received higher-dimensional filtered chaotic signal by using techniques from the theory of pattern recognition. Our results show that a message bearing chaotic signal can be transmitted over a low bandwidth physical channel and be decoded with a low decoding bit error rate.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Are the fractal skeletons the explanation for the narrowing of arteries due to cell trapping in a disturbed blood flow?,Computers in biology and medicine,"We show that common circulatory diseases, such as stenoses and aneurysms, generate chaotic advection of blood particles. This phenomenon has major consequences on the way the biochemical particles behave. Chaotic advection leads to a peculiar filamentary particle distribution, which in turn creates a favorable environment for particle reactions. Furthermore, we argue that the enhanced stretching dynamics induced by chaos can lead to the activation of platelets, particles involved in the thrombus formation. In particular, we vary the size of both stenoses and aneurysms, and model them under resting and exercising conditions. We show that the filamentary particle distribution, governed by the fractal skeleton, depends on the size of the vessel wall irregularity, and investigate how it varies under resting or exercising conditions.","00104825, 18790534",8.403

This system is investigated for parameter values at which it is strongly non-hyperbolic through a mechanism called unstable dimension variability, through which there are periodic orbits embedded in a chaotic attractor with different numbers of unstable directions. Our numerical investigation is primarily based on the analysis of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents, which gives us useful hints about the onset and evolution of unstable dimension variability for the double rotor map, as a system parameter (the forcing amplitude) is varied.",01039733,1.643

We apply the OFE method to a scattering system, and compare it to the uncertainty method. We use the OFE method to study the behavior of the fractal dimension as the system's dynamics undergoes a topological transition.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Feedback synchronization using pole-placement control,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Synchronization in chaotic systems has become an active area of research since the pioneering work of Pecora and Carroll.

Tracer dynamics in a flow of driven vortices,Physical Review E,"From numerical computations of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, we derive a low-dimensional stream-function model that captures the essential properties of the dynamics of an array of driven vortices in time-periodic regime. Using this analytical model, we study the Lagrangian dynamics of passive tracers and show that it is essentially controlled by the existence of a chaotic saddle. We obtain its stable and unstable manifolds, which in turn, yield an approximation of the chaotic saddle in terms of their intersections. By introducing symbolic dynamics, the spatiotemporal properties of the flow, including an alternative approximation of the chaotic saddle, are described in terms of measures of complexity.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Artificial intelligence enhances the performance of chaotic baseband wireless communication,IET Communications,"It was reported recently that chaos properties could be used to relieve inter‐symbol interference caused by multipath propagation in chaos‐based wireless communication system. Although there exists the optimal decoding threshold to theoretically eliminate the inter‐symbol interference, its practical implementation is still a challenge due to the strong requirement to know the future symbols to be transmitted. To tackle this almost ‘impossible’ task, convolutional neural network with deep learning structure is proposed to predict future symbols based on the received signal, to further reduce inter‐symbol interference and to obtain a better bit error rate performance. Due to the short time predictability of chaotic signal, the proposed method is able to predict short‐term future symbols and get a better threshold suitable for the time‐variant channel.

Chaos theory and applications: a retrospective on lessons learned and missed or new opportunities,Nonlinear Dynamics,"Chaos, from the Greek khaos,“abyss, that which gapes wide open, that which is vast and empty”, is a relatively young scientific discipline, which however has old and important roots, dating back (at least) to James Clerk Maxwell in 1860 and Henry Poincaré in 1890. The birth of the modern age of Chaos is commonly referred to the work of Edward Lorenz in 1963. After this triggering point, it became a flourishing and fascinating research field, that attracted the interest of top scientists as well as many valuable researchers, still active to date. Looking for the word “Chaos” in modern research tools an almost uncountable number of papers appear. After 60 years of huge developments, after books (J. Gleick, Chaos; R. Abraham and Y. Ueda, The Chaos Avant-Garde: Memories of the Early Days of Chaos Theory; etc.) and Symposia (IUTAM Symposium on 50 Years of Chaos: Applied and Theoretical, Kyoto, 2011, etc.), we felt it was the right time for a pitstop, aimed at looking:(i) backward, of course, to “summarize” the major developments and their applications, successes and failures;(ii) forward, to see the new ongoing developments of this fascinating discipline and future perspectives, in particular unexplored ones; and (iii) laterally, ie to works that, while strictly not classifiable as belonging to the chaos family, are close and relevant indeed, having common features. We have also tried to give an answer, that is necessarily partial and incomplete, to the questions “Who were we?”,“Who are we?”,“Who will we be?” in Chaos.

Model-free adaptive nonlinear control of the absorption refrigeration system,Nonlinear Dynamics,"Based on the model-free adaptive control (MFAC) theory, the temperature tracking control problem of single-effect LiBr/H2O absorption chiller is explored. Due to the complex nonlinearity and strong coupling characteristics of the absorption refrigeration system, model-free adaptive control strategy is designed for its temperature tracking control. Nevertheless, the traditional model-free adaptive control has a slow tracking speed and poor denoising ability. In order to improve its control effect, output error rate is added to the objective function and new control laws of model-free adaptive control with output error rate (MFAC-OER) have been derived through an exhaustive convergence and stability analysis.

Conductance fluctuations in chaotic bilayer graphene quantum dots,Physical Review E,"Previous studies of quantum chaotic scattering established a connection between classical dynamics and quantum transport properties: Integrable or mixed classical dynamics can lead to sharp conductance fluctuations but chaos is capable of smoothing out the conductance variations. Relativistic quantum transport through single-layer graphene systems, for which the quasiparticles are massless Dirac fermions, exhibits, due to scarring, this classical-quantum correspondence, but sharp conductance fluctuations persist to a certain extent even when the classical system is fully chaotic. There is an open issue regarding the effect of finite mass on relativistic quantum transport. To address this issue, we study quantum transport in chaotic bilayer graphene quantum dots for which the quasiparticles have a finite mass. An interesting phenomenon is that, when traveling along the classical ballistic orbit, the quasiparticle …","24700045, 24700053",2.266

Approximate solution for frequency synchronization in a finite-size Kuramoto model,Physical Review E,"Scientists have been considering the Kuramoto model to understand the mechanism behind the appearance of collective behavior, such as frequency synchronization (FS) as a paradigm, in real-world networks with a finite number of oscillators. A major current challenge is to obtain an analytical solution for the phase angles. Here, we provide an approximate analytical solution for this problem by deriving a master solution for the finite-size Kuramoto model, with arbitrary finite-variance distribution of the natural frequencies of the oscillators. The master solution embodies all particular solutions of the finite-size Kuramoto model for any frequency distribution and coupling strength larger than the critical one. Furthermore, we present a criterion to determine the stability of the FS solution. This allows one to analytically infer the relationship between the physical parameters and the stable behavior of networks.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
A complex biological system: the fly's visual module,"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","Is the characterization of biological systems as complex systems in the mathematical sense a fruitful assertion?

We use the fly's visual system as an example and analyse our experimental results of one particular neuron in the fly's visual system from this point of view. We find that the motion-sensitive ‘H1’ neuron, which converts incoming signals into a sequence of identical pulses or ‘spikes’, encodes the information contained in the stimulus into an alphabet composed of a few letters. This encoding occurs on multilayered sets, one of the features attributed to complex systems.

Stability properties of nonhyperbolic chaotic attractors with respect to noise,Physical Review Letters,"We study local and global stability of nonhyperbolic chaotic attractors contaminated by noise. The former is given by the maximum distance of a noisy trajectory from the noisefree attractor, while the latter is provided by the minimal escape energy necessary to leave the basin of attraction, calculated with the Hamiltonian theory of large fluctuations. We establish the important and counterintuitive result that both concepts may be opposed to each other. Even when one attractor is globally more stable than another one, it can be locally less stable. Our results are exemplified with the Holmes map, for two different sets of parameter, and with a juxtaposition of the Holmes and the Ikeda maps. Finally, the experimental relevance of these findings is pointed out.","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Rainbow transition in chaotic scattering,Physical Review E,"We study the effects of classical chaotic scattering on the differential cross section, which is the measurable quantity in most scattering experiments. We show that the fractal set of singularities in the deflection function is not, in general, reflected on the differential cross section. We show that there are systems in which, as the energy (or some other parameter) crosses a critical value, the system’s differential cross-section changes from a singular function having an infinite set of rainbow singularities with structure in all scales to a smooth function with no singularities, the scattering being chaotic on both sides of the transition. We call this metamorphosis the rainbow transition. We exemplify this transition with a physically relevant class of systems. These results have important consequences for the problem of inverse scattering in chaotic systems and for the experimental observation of chaotic scattering.","24700045, 24700053",2.266

Strange nonchaotic attractors in a periodically forced piecewise linear system with noise,Fractals,"The study of strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) has been mainly restricted to quasiperiodically forced systems.

SNAs can be generated in different periodic windows with weak noise perturbation. If the parameter is varied further from the chaotic range, a larger noise intensity is required to induce SNAs. Besides, noise-induced SNAs can be generated by the periodic attractors near the boundary crisis. In addition, with the increasing noise intensity, the intermittency between SNAs and periodic attractors can be induced by transient chaos.

The proof also implies the boundedness of the energy of all solutions for a new class of Fermi-Ulam model with one of the walls replaced by a potential which is growing to infinity as the position coordinate approaches to the origin. When the motion of boundary is piecewise smooth, the dynamics near infinity is either elliptic or hyperbolic depending on an explicit parameter, which is similar to the results in [11] for the piecewise smooth Fermi-Ulam model.

By combining two kinds of MTSC methods, including the methods based on feature representation transformation and Deep Neural Network (DNN), we propose a new classification method for Multivariate Time Series (MTS). Multivariate monitoring data of AUV are fused to construct complex networks as graphs to represent the motion states. Then, Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) is used to extract the features of the graphs and classify the graphs. The effectiveness of our method is validated through sea experiments, whose data are from three classes of navigational motions: near the surface, at fixed depth, and influenced by unknown ocean currents at …",00298018,5.148
Quasi-periodic solutions and homoclinic bifurcation in an impact inverted pendulum,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"We investigate a nonlinear inverted pendulum impacting between two rigid walls under external periodic excitation. Based on KAM theory, we prove that there are three regions (corresponding to different energies) occupied by quasi-periodic solutions in phase space when the periodic excitation is small. Moreover, the rotational quasi-periodic motion is maintained when the perturbation gets larger. The existence of subharmonic periodic solutions is obtained by the Aubry–Mather theory and the boundedness of all solutions is followed by the fact that there exist abundant invariant tori near infinity. To study the homoclinic bifurcation of this system, we present a numerical method to compute the discontinuous invariant manifolds accurately, which provides a useful tool for the study of invariant manifolds under the effect of impacts.",01672789,3.117
Multivariate empirical mode decomposition and multiscale entropy analysis of EEG signals from SSVEP-based BCI system,Europhysics Letters,"The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has been employed in the brain-controlled wheelchair system for patients with severe dyskinesia disease. However, a long-time operation brings about users fatigue, leading to a decrease of performance of the BCI system in practical applications. The characterization of the fatigued mechanism and the improvement of the SSVEP classification accuracy remains a challenging problem of significant importance. In this letter, we first conduct SSVEP experiments to acquire the EEG signals during both normal and fatigued states.

Diffusion in randomly perturbed dissipative dynamics,Europhysics Letters,"Dynamical systems having many coexisting attractors present interesting properties from both fundamental theoretical and modelling points of view. When such dynamics is under bounded random perturbations, the basins of attraction are no longer invariant and there is the possibility of transport among them. Here we introduce a basic theoretical setting which enables us to study this hopping process from the perspective of anomalous transport using the concept of a random dynamical system with holes. We apply it to a simple model by investigating the role of hyperbolicity for the transport among basins. We show numerically that our system exhibits non-Gaussian position distributions, power-law escape times, and subdiffusion. Our simulation results are reproduced consistently from stochastic continuous time random walk theory.","02955075, 12864854",1.8

Extreme final state sensitivity in inhomogeneous spatiotemporal chaotic systems,Physics Letters A,"Recently it has been found that spatiotemporal chaotic systems modeled by coupled map lattices with translational symmetry exhibit an extreme type of final state sensitivity characterized by a near-zero uncertainty exponent in both phase space and parameter space. A perturbation in initial condition and parameter, no matter how small from the point of view of computation, has a significant probability of altering the system's asymptotic attractor completely. In this paper we demonstrate that such a final state sensitivity persists for spatiotemporal systems without symmetry. This suggests that extreme final state sensitivity is a robust dynamical phenomenon spatiotemporal chaotic systems.","00036951, 10773118",3.462

One node driving synchronisation,Scientific Reports,"Abrupt changes of behaviour in complex networks can be triggered by a single node. This work describes the dynamical fundamentals of how the behaviour of one node affects the whole network formed by coupled phase-oscillators with heterogeneous coupling strengths. The synchronisation of phase-oscillators is independent of the distribution of the natural frequencies, weakly depends on the network size, but highly depends on only one key oscillator whose ratio between its natural frequency in a rotating frame and its coupling strength is maximum. This result is based on a novel method to calculate the critical coupling strength with which the phase-oscillators emerge into frequency synchronisation. In addition, we put forward an analytical method to approximately calculate the phase-angles for the synchronous oscillators.",20452322,3.883
Active networks that maximize the amount of information transmission,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"This work clarifies the relationship between network circuit (topology) and behavior (information transmission and synchronization) in active networks, e.g. neural networks.

By optimal, we mean that the network is able to transmit a large amount of information, it possesses a large number of communication channels, and it is robust under large variations of the network coupling configuration. This theoretical approach is general and does not depend on the particular dynamic of the elements forming the network, since the network topology can be determined by finding a Laplacian matrix (the matrix that describes the connections and the coupling strengths among the elements) whose eigenvalues satisfy some special conditions.

In viewing such time evolution, words such as wild, random, and turbulent come to mind. Furthermore, this basic type of motion is extremely common and occurs in a vast variety of fields. Examples are the motion of thermally convecting fluids, the fluctuations of light intensity in certain laser systems, the motion of celestial bodies (for example, two planets circling a star), and even the irregular beating of a diseased heart.

Phase locking control in the Circle Map,Nonlinear Dynamics,"The phase-locking between two oscillators occurs when the ratio of their frequencies becomes locked in a ratio p/q of integer numbers over some finite domain of parameters values. Due to it, oscillators with some kind of nonlinear coupling may synchronize for certain set of parameters. This phenomenon can be better understood and studied with the use of a well-known paradigm, the Circle Map, and the definition of the winding number. Two diagrams related to this map are especially useful: the ‘Arnold tongues’ and the ‘devil’s staircase’. The synchronization that occurs in this map is described by the ‘Farey Series’. This property is the starting point for the development of control algorithms capable of locking the system under the action of an external excitation into a desired winding number.

The expression for the ponderomotive Hamiltonian is then taken in the limit of unmagnetized particles and used in an analysis of charged-particle-beam confinement by ponderomotive force due to a waveguide mode. Formulas for the rf power and energy density inside the waveguide needed to confine a beam with a given kinetic energy and current are then derived.

Community control in cellular protein production: consequences for amino acid starvation,"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","Deprivation of essential nutrients can have stark consequences for many processes in a cell. We consider amino acid starvation, which can result in bottlenecks in mRNA translation when ribosomes stall due to lack of resources, i.e. tRNAs charged with the missing amino acid. Recent experiments also show less obvious effects such as increased charging of other (non-starved) tRNA species and selective charging of isoaccepting tRNAs. We present a mechanism which accounts for these observations and shows that production of some proteins can actually increase under starvation. One might assume that such responses could only be a result of sophisticated control pathways, but here we show that these effects can occur naturally due to changes in the supply and demand for different resources, and that control can be accomplished through selective use of rare codons.

Chaotic advection and fractality: applications in oceanography,OCEANS 2007-Europe,"Fluid motion, like in environmental flows, may generate chaotic advection: the particles transported by the flow typically exhibit chaotic dynamics. This manifests itself in that the particles trace out complicated geometrical objects, filamentary fractal structures. The appearance of these complex fractal structures plays an important role if the advected particles are chemically or biologically active. In fact, traditional chemical rate equations and population dynamical equations must be modified to incorporate this effect. For example, plankton population dynamics may be influenced by the emerging filamentary patterns. Other examples may include mixing and evaporation of oil spills, or melting of sea-ice.",-,153.0
Signal Dropout Reconstruction in Communicating with Chaos,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"A chaotic system can be guided by tiny perturbations to follow a previously chosen path in phase space carrying a desired sequence of binary symbols. We discuss how to exploit redundancy and flexibility of the chaotic carriers to reconstruct possible signal dropouts incurred in the communication channel, even in the case in which the receiver has no information about the chaotic system on which the message is coded. A crucial issue is whether the natural evolution of the selected chaotic system displays prohibited sequences. We show how to optimize the message recovering process, and how this last one is strictly related to the natural properties of the chaotic sources.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Lai and grebogi reply,Physical Review Letters,"The scaling relations derived analytically and tested numerically in our paper occur only after the riddling bifurcation because, before the bifurcation, almost every point in the vicinity of the invariant subspace asymptotes to the periodic attractor. The scaling is, therefore, a property associated with riddling of chaotic saddles in the setting that we considered. In fact, the analytic example that we constructed to derive the scaling relation pointed most emphatically to the fact that we were dealing with riddling of chaotic sets, as the model was resolved by using a random walk type of diffusion equation. The dynamics of the periodic attractor is not directly involved with the scaling relations. The Comment states that any map with a repelling fixed point can exhibit a similar scaling, but we believe it is totally irrelevant to the riddling phenomenon studied in our Letter.","00319007, 10797114",8.106

Sudden regime shifts after apparent stasis: Comment on “Long transients in ecology: Theory and applications” by Andrew Morozov et al.,Physics of life reviews,"The present review article by Andrew Morozov and co-authors is timely and highly relevant to ecological systems [1]. Long-term predictions constitute a fundamental challenge in ecology, epidemiology and climate science. Reliable forecasting is difficult because of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the hallmark of chaos)[2], noise, and incomplete data. Another obstacle to reliable prediction of ecosystems is a phenomenon known as “regime shift”[3], where any conclusions or estimates based on the observations made before the regime shift become irrelevant after the shift. The timing of the regime shift is difficult to predict and the problem of identifying early warning signals remains largely open. Regime shift often results in a population collapse and extinction of species [4], making it an important issue for nature conservation and ecosystem management. Recently, it has been shown that regime shift can be a property of long transients-an alternative explanation that does not require any parameter change. That is, the presence of long transients may provide an alternative explanation of sudden regimes shifts which may lead to species extinction and biodiversity loss.
There are other reasons to study transient dynamics [5] in general. Traditionally, longterm dynamics have been thought to correspond to the asymptotic behaviour of the biological system, where trajectories have settled on some “final state,” eg, an equilibrium or a cycle. However, there is a growing body of empirical evidence and modelling studies showing that transient behaviour and especially long transients can play a pivotal role in the dynamics of ecosystems [6].

Optimality in DNA repair,Journal of theoretical biology,"DNA within cells is subject to damage from various sources. Organisms have evolved a number of mechanisms to repair DNA damage.

We use this model to show that there is an optimum level of repair enzymes within cells which optimises the cell's response to damage. This optimal level is explained as the best trade-off between fast repair and a low probability of causing double-stranded breaks.

When the diffusion of Brownian particles is constrained to the double- or triple-circular cavity, the presence of irregular boundaries leads to entropic barriers. The interplay between the entropic barriers, a periodic input signal, the gravity of particles, and intrinsic thermal noise may give rise to a peak in the spectral amplification factor and therefore to the appearance of the ESR phenomenon.

Suppressing chaos in crystal growth process using adaptive phase resonant perturbation,Nonlinear Dynamics,"Chaos occurs in the flexible shaft rotating-lifting (FSRL) system of crystal growth process.

In this work, a small amplitude resonant perturbation to the rotation speed is being proposed to suppress chaos in the FSRL system. The system state, given by the swing angle between the rotation center on the vertical axis and the soft shaft, is observed by measuring the force on the soft shaft and by using the untraced Kalman filter.

We demonstrate the existence of an invariant set for the map F, on which the map is topologically semi-conjugate to the one-sided symbolic dynamical system with two symbols. Therefore, the map exhibits chaotic behavior in the sense of Li-Yorke. For a real polynomial f (x) of degree 1, there exist new types of Smale horseshoes and uniformly hyperbolic invariant sets.

Driving trajectories to a desirable mode in an axially accelerating beam system,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"In this work, the transverse vibration of axially accelerating beam system is taken as the paradigmatic system to study the switching of vibrations from one mode to another.

When an orbit satisfies a proximity constraint with the desired orbit, the control action is applied intermittently in the time domain. This intermittent control is achieved by perturbing one of the attractors with an impulsive force, thereby switching the system response to the other attractor. The stability of the method is analyzed mathematically, while its effectiveness is verified by numerical results. The influence of constrained intermittent control on the system and the intensity and duration of intermittent inputs are also further analyzed.","02181274, 17936551",2.088

The quantitative analysis results show that there are significant differences in brain topologies between the alert and fatigue states. And experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 94.71% for driving fatigue …","02955075, 12864854",1.8
Crisis dynamics of a class of single-degree-of-freedom piecewise linear oscillators,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","We investigate boundary crises, interior crises, and merging crises of a class of single-degree-of-freedom piecewise linear oscillators. From the perspective of the tangency of manifolds, the mechanisms of boundary crises are revealed, and the critical exponents are determined to distinguish between homoclinic crises and heteroclinic crises. As the parameter changes continuously, a chaotic orbit suddenly disappear at a certain critical point and reappear suddenly at another critical point. This phenomenon of two sudden changes in the chaotic orbit is related to boundary crises caused by the tangency of the stable and unstable manifolds of the same unstable periodic orbit. We call the regions formed by the intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable period orbits associated with boundary crises as the escape regions. The change in the area of the escape regions induces the sudden …",09600779,5.969
Dynamics of bouncing convex body,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","We consider a dynamical system that describes a convex planer body with a smooth boundary, which falls under the influence of gravity and is elastically reflected upon hitting a wall. Under suitable restriction on the system’s parameters, the system is equivalent to a billiard problem within a cylinder. We prove that the dynamics of the system is intimately linked to a variational problem, corresponding to a twist map. Moreover, we utilise the established variational method to investigate the stability of trivial periodic orbits and near-integrable dynamics when this planar body closely approximates a disc with its centre of mass at the geometric centre. Numerical results illustrates our mathematical findings and highlight the system’s intricate dynamics.",09600779,5.969

In this paper, techniques of symbolic dynamics are used to analyze the chaotic dynamical properties of a two-parameter family of piecewise smooth unimodal maps with one break point. Boundary crisis and interior crisis are described via the kneading sequences, while for the period-3 window, a subshift of finite type is constructed. In addition, based on the symbolic model, the topological entropy of the map is computed, and the existence of chaotic sets of Smale horseshoe type is also proved.","15313492, 1553524X",1.467
Many-body spectral statistics of relativistic quantum billiard systems,Physical Review Research,"In the field of quantum chaos, spectral statistics is one of the most extensively investigated characteristics. Despite a large body of existing literature, the effects of many-body interactions on the spectral statistics of relativistic quantum systems remain poorly understood. Treating electron-electron interactions through the one-orbital mean-field Hubbard model, we address this fundamental issue using graphene billiards with the geometric shape of a circular sector as prototypical systems. Our approach is to consider the two characteristically different cases where the statistics are Poisson and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) so the corresponding classical dynamics are typically integrable and chaotic, respectively, and to systematically investigate how the statistics change as the Hubbard interaction strength increases from zero. We find that, for energies near the Dirac point, the Hubbard interactions have a …",26431564,3.772

To celebrate Sir Michael Berry's eightieth birthday, here we report results on the role of geometric symmetries of the billiard system in relativistic quantum scarring. In particular, we investigate a Dirac billiard system with a four-fold rotational symmetry whose classical dynamics are fully chaotic. The system is described by the massless Dirac equation in the fundamental domain that consists of one fourth of the full billiard, with proper boundary conditions on the symmetry lines to preserve the physical properties under the symmetry operations. We show that the relativistic quantum characteristics of spin induced phase play a fundamental role in the quantum behaviors of the Dirac particle in the billiard.

Keywords: KAM theory Quasi-periodic solution Impact system Computation of discontinuous invariant manifold,PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA,"We investigate a nonlinear inverted pendulum impacting between two rigid walls under external periodic excitation. Based on KAM theory, we prove that there are three regions (corresponding to different energies) occupied by quasi-periodic solutions in phase space when the periodic excitation is small. Moreover, the rotational quasi-periodic motion is maintained when the perturbation gets larger. The existence of subharmonic periodic solutions is obtained by the Aubry-Mather theory and the boundedness of all solutions is followed by the fact that there exist abundant invariant tori near infinity. To study the homoclinic bifurcation of this system, we present a numerical method to compute the discontinuous invariant manifolds accurately, which provides a useful tool for the study of invariant manifolds under the effect of impacts.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Invariant torus and its destruction for an oscillator with dry friction,Nonlinear Dynamics,"Mechanical systems with dry friction are typical Filippov systems. Such class of systems have complicated dynamical behaviors due to the existence of sliding motion. In this work, we consider a one-degree-of-freedom oscillator with dry friction force. The phase map is derived to reduce the system to a circle map, and then, the existence of forward invariant torus is proved under suitable assumptions. Moreover, the typical resonance phenomenon and the grazing bifurcation of invariant torus are discussed. We find that the destruction of invariant tori is due to a loss of transversality for sufficiently large perturbation, which is different from the usual smooth tori dynamics.","0924090X, 1573269X",5.891

Uncovering hidden flows in physical networks,Europhysics Letters,"Understanding the interactions among nodes in a complex network is of great importance, since they disclose how these nodes are cooperatively supporting the functioning of the network. Scientists have developed numerous methods to uncover the underlying adjacent physical connectivity based on measurements of functional quantities of the nodes states. Often, the physical connectivity, the adjacency matrix, is available. Yet, little is known about how this adjacent connectivity impacts on the"" hidden"" flows being exchanged between any two arbitrary nodes, after travelling longer non-adjacent paths. In this letter, we show that hidden physical flows in conservative flow networks, a quantity that is usually inaccessible to measurements, can be determined by the interchange of physical flows between any pair of adjacent nodes.

Exact detection of direct links in networks of interacting dynamical units,New Journal of Physics,"The inference of an underlying network topology from local observations of a complex system composed of interacting units is usually attempted by using statistical similarity measures, such as cross-correlation (CC) and mutual information (MI). The possible existence of a direct link between different units is, however, hindered within the time-series measurements. Here we show that, for the class of systems studied, when an abrupt change in the ordered set of CC or MI values exists, it is possible to infer, without errors, the underlying network topology from the time-series measurements, even in the presence of observational noise, non-identical units, and coupling heterogeneity. We find that a necessary condition for the discontinuity to occur is that the dynamics of the coupled units is partially coherent, ie, neither complete disorder nor globally synchronous patterns are present. We critically compare the inference methods based on CC and MI, in terms of how effective, robust, and reliable they are, and conclude that, in general, MI outperforms CC in robustness and reliability. Our findings could be relevant for the construction and interpretation of functional networks, such as those constructed from brain or climate data.",13672630,2.844
Additional information on Chaos,Chaos,"Nonlinear dynamical systems with one or a few parameters varying slowly with time are of considerable interest in many areas of science and engineering. In such a system, the attractors in the future can be characteristically different from those at the present. To predict the possible future attractors based on available information at the present is thus a well-defined and meaningful problem, which is challenging especially when the system equations are not known but only time-series measurements are available. Here, we extend our recently developed, compressive-sensing based method for predicting catastrophic bifurcations in stationary dynamical systems to time-varying systems. We demonstrate that this framework allows us to reconstruct the system equations and time dependence of parameters based on limited measurements so that the future attractors of the system can be predicted through computation.","10541500, 10897682",2.755
Modeling Experimental Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaotic Scenarios,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,"Thinking about nonlinearity in engineering areas, up to the 70s, was focused on intentionally built nonlinear parts in order to improve the operational characteristics of a device or system. Keying, saturation, hysteretic phenomena, and dead zones were added to existing devices increasing their behavior diversity and precision. In this context, an intrinsic nonlinearity was treated just as a linear approximation, around equilibrium points. Approximation methods and Lyapunov stability theorems elegantly solved the dynamical behavior analysis problems and gave hints about how to synthesize systems with some desired properties. At that time, bifurcation and chaos were not present in engineers’ daily life.
Chaotic dynamics was discovered at the end of the nineteenth century, by Henry Poincaré as a result from nonlinear phenomena subjected to qualitative changes in their behavior, provoked by bifurcations due to parameter variations. By studying the mathematical model of the circular restricted three-body problem, he was able to glimpse the chaotic motion that appears in complicated and apparently unpredictable trajectories that were close to periodic orbits, but spread fully in bounded regions of the phase space. Analyzing this motion, he concluded that “... it may happen that small differences in the initial conditions produce very great ones in the final phenomena. A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the latter. Prediction becomes impossible, and we have the fortuitous phenomenon.” In the last couple of decades of the twentieth century, the profound impact of chaos in science, engineering, and medicine was …","1024123X, 15635147",1.699

SCIENCE ES 145-312 QA 00592 VV. 3 10.2,Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems: Series B.,"Due to their mathematical tractability, two-dimensional (2D) fluid equations are often used by mathematicians as a model for quasi-geostrophic (QG) turbulence in the atmosphere, using Charney's 1971 paper as justification. Superficially, 2D and QG turbulence both satisfy the twin conservation of energy and enstrophy and thus are unlike 3D flows, which do not conserve enstrophy. Yet QG turbulence differs from 2D turbulence in fundamental ways, which are not generally known. Here we discuss ingredients missing in 2D turbulence formulations of large-scale atmospheric turbulence. We argue that there is no proof that energy cannot cascade downscale in QG turbulence. Indeed, observational evidence supports a downscale flux of both energy and enstrophy in the mesoscales. It is suggested that the observed atmospheric energy spectrum is explainable if there is a downscale energy cascade of QG turbulence, but is inconsistent with 2D turbulence theories, which require an upscale energy flux. A simple solved example is used to illustrate some of the ideas discussed.","15313492, 1553524X",1.467

Necessity of statistical modeling of deterministic chaotic systems,AIP Conference Proceedings,"The success of deterministic modeling of a physical system relies on whether the solution of the model would approximate the dynamics of the actual system. When the system is chaotic, situations can arise where periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic set have distinct number of unstable directions, a dynamical property known as unstable dimension variability. As a consequence, no model of the system produces reasonably long trajectories that are realized by nature. We argue and present physical examples indicating that, in such a case, though the model is deterministic and low-dimensional, statistical quantities can still be reliably computed. We also argue that unstable dimension variability may be common in high-dimensional chaotic systems such as those arising from discretization of nonlinear partial differential equations.","0094243X, 15517616",13516.0

Breaking an image encryption algorithm based on DNA encoding and spatiotemporal chaos,Entropy,"Recently, an image encryption algorithm based on DNA encoding and spatiotemporal chaos (IEA-DESC) was proposed. In IEA-DESC, pixel diffusion, DNA encoding, DNA-base permutation and DNA decoding are performed successively to generate cipher-images from the plain-images. Some security analyses and simulation results are given to prove that it can withstand various common attacks. However, in this paper, it is found that IEA-DESC has some inherent security defects as follows: (1) the pixel diffusion is invalid for attackers from the perspective of cryptanalysis; (2) the combination of DNA encoding and DNA decoding is equivalent to bitwise complement; (3) the DNA-base permutation is actually a fixed position shuffling operation for quaternary elements, which has been proved to be insecure. In summary, IEA-DESC is essentially a combination of a fixed DNA-base position permutation and bitwise complement. Therefore, IEA-DESC can be equivalently represented as simplified form, and its security solely depends on the equivalent secret key.

Design and implementation of multi-wing butterfly chaotic attractors via Lorenz-type systems,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Lorenz system, as the first classical chaotic system, has been intensively investigated over the last four decades.

Distributed adaptive resilient formation control of uncertain nonholonomic mobile robots under deception attacks,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,"This paper investigates the formation control problem for a group of nonholonomic mobile robots (NMRs) with unknown parameters and deception attacks. The information transmitted among different robots is represented by a directed graph and only a subset of the robots can obtain the full information of the desired trajectory directly. For those robots which cannot access to the reference trajectory directly, distributed estimators are designed to estimate the unknown trajectory information by using only locally available information. Besides, the sensor-to-controller transmitting channels and the communication among connected robots are suffering from deception attacks. Adaptive laws and compensation terms are designed to handle the issue of attack-induced uncertainties.

Employing the impulsive control method which is simple, efficient, low cost, and easy to implement in practical applications, we obtain some sufficient conditions of outer synchronization. It indicates that outer synchronization can be achieved if the maximal impulsive intervals are less than a critical value. Numerical simulations are also given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed impulsive control scheme.","0924090X, 1573269X",5.891

In contrast with the traditional centralized observer with the ability to acquire full output of the plant, we design a set of distributed observers, each having access to partial output of the plant through a distributed sensor network. More specifically, each observer obtains partial plant output and communicates with its neighboring observers through consensus protocols. The communication among the network is subject to arbitrarily large time delays.

To solve the output regulation problem in this case, we proposed a cooperative output regulation network, where each agent obtains a part of system output measurement on states of plant and exosystem. Distributed state observers and disturbance observers are designed in order to fuse the observed data.

Convergence rate for discrete-time multiagent systems with time-varying delays and general coupling coefficients,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,"Multiagent systems (MASs) are ubiquitous in our real world. There is an increasing attention focusing on the consensus (or synchronization) problem of MASs over the past decade. Although there are numerous results reported on the convergence of a discrete-time MAS based on the infinite products of matrices, few results are on the convergence rate. Because of the switching topology, the traditional eigenvalue analysis and the Lyapunov function methods are both invalid for the convergence rate analysis of an MAS with a switching topology. Therefore, the estimation of the convergence rate for a discrete-time MAS with time-varying delays remains a difficult problem. To overcome the essential difficulty of switching topology, this paper aims at developing a contractive-set approach to analyze the convergence rate of a discrete-time MAS in the presence of time-varying delays and generalized coupling coefficients …","2162237X, 21622388",11.831

Spectral learning algorithm reveals propagation capability of complex networks,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,"In network science and the data mining field, a long-lasting and significant task is to predict the propagation capability of nodes in a complex network.

However, in degree uncorrelated networks, this paper finds that PR and LR are actually proportional to in-degree of nodes. As a result, the two algorithms fail to accurately predict the nodes' propagation capability. To overcome the arising drawback, this paper proposes a new iterative algorithm called SpectralRank (SR), in which the nodes' propagation capability is assumed to be proportional to the amount of its neighbors after adding a ground node to the network. Moreover, a weighted SR algorithm is also proposed to further involve a priori information of a node itself. A probabilistic …","10834419, 19410492",0.0

Adaptive diffusion processes of time-varying local information on networks,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,"This brief mainly discusses the diffusion on complex networks with time-varying couplings. We propose a model to describe the adaptive diffusion process of local topological and dynamical information, and find that the Barabasi-Albert scale-free network is beneficial to the diffusion and leads nodes to arrive at a larger state value than other networks do. The ability of diffusion for a node is related to its own degree. Specifically, nodes with smaller degrees are more likely to change their states and reach larger values, while those with larger degrees tend to stick to their original states. We introduce state entropy to analyze the thermodynamic mechanism of the diffusion process, and interestingly find that this kind of diffusion process is a minimization process of state entropy. We use the inequality constrained optimization method to reveal the restriction function of the minimization and find that it has the same form as …","15497747, 15583791",4.475
Pinning observability in complex networks,IET Control Theory & Applications,"A new concept called pinning observability for complex networks is first proposed in this study. It is well known that in a very large‐scale network, there are many nodes as well as lots of connections among the nodes. Thus, it is literally impossible to observe states of all the nodes so as to recover the network by reaching synchronisation between the original network and a newly constructed network. To reduce the number of observable nodes’ states, some feedback controllers can be applied on a small fraction of the chosen nodes to realise the synchronisation. Hence, the new concept pinning observability in complex networks is introduced for this purpose. First, a general criterion for synchronisation via pinning observability in complex networks with linear coupling is given based on which the parametric regions for pinning observability are discussed. Then, some decoupled and easily verified conditions for …","17518644, 17518652",2.498

Optimizing synchronizability of multilayer networks based on the graph comparison method,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,"This paper is aimed at optimizing the synchronizability of a complex network when the total of its edge weights is given and fixed. We try to allocate edge weights on a complex network to optimize the network's synchronizability from the perspective of spectral graph theory. Most of the existing analysis on multilayer networks assumes the weights of intralayer or interlayer edges to be identical. Such a restrictive assumption is not made in this work. Using the graph comparison based method, different edge weights are allocated according to topological features of networks, which is more reasonable and consistent with most physical complex networks. Furthermore, in order to find out the best edge-weight allocation scheme, we carried out numerical simulations on typical duplex networks and real-world networks.

A threshold effect of coupling delays on intra-layer synchronization in duplex networks,Science China Technological Sciences,"This paper investigates the impact of inter-layer coupling functions and intra-layer coupling delays on intra-layer synchronization regions and sychronizability. It is found that the inter-layer coupling functions have great influence on intra-layer synchronization regions, as well as on the intra-layer synchronizability. In particular, there exists an inter-layer coupling function such that the inter-layer coupling strength neither improves nor weakens the intra-layer synchronizability. Furthermore, no matter which one of three inter-layer coupling functions is chosen, a small intra-layer delay always keeps the intra-layer synchronized regions almost unchanged, implying that the small delay neither enhances nor suppresses the intra-layer synchronizability. At the same time the delay greatly frustrates the synchronizability in each layer when it is greater than some threshold. Our results may have potential applications for …","16747321, 18691900",4.553

First, the radial profiles of the shock downstream parameters are always different from the upstream profiles due to the magnetic effects. Second, the critical Mach number for the shock existence will depend on the shock carried current (ie, magnetic field). As an example, a set of shock downstream profiles is provided numerically when the upstream profiles are taken as a kind of typical equilibrium profiles of a Z-pinch-Bennett profiles.

Qualifying and Quantifying IT Services Added Values in Outsourcing Assignments—Service Value Agreement,Journal of Service Science and Management,"Traditionally, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) including service level metrics is used as an appendix in IT Service Management agreements to define the terms and conditions of delivery and set expectations. However, SLA neither implies nor guarantees the added values that are expected by the customer. Besides, due to the nature of IT services, there always exists uncertainty about the agreed services due to which the perceived risk for both customer and provider is high. Moreover, the quality and quantity of delivered values are mostly hidden by hazy marketing slogans. In order to guarantee the values of an offered service, the deliverable added values should be characterized properly, quantified by means of measurable metrics, and agreed upon between the two parties. Such comprehensive material, including the deliverable added values along with their measurable metrics, is called Service Value Agreement (SVA). This research proposes a platform for IT service offerings based on added values by identifying, as well as quantifying, an organization’s objectives in purchasing Application Management (AM) services from a provider firm.","17442370, 17442389",0.64
3D reconstruction from planar points: A candidate method for authentication of fingerprint images captured by mobile devices,2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),"With the widely application of mobile commerce (m-commerce), there is an urgent need to introduce identity authentication mechanism to mobile devices and make m-commerce secure to users. Since fingerprints can be viewed as an important characteristic of a natural person, fingerprint authentication (FA) can provide excellent access control for mobile phone users. Generally speaking, there exist two methods for applying of FA to mobile devices: one solution is trying to introduce an extra sensor to a mobile device, the other solution is trying to authenticate an image captured by a mobile device directly. However, the drawback of the first method is that devices with specific sensors are usually unavailable, the critical difficulty for the second solution comes from minutiae matching since different images would be obtained by a camera with different snap in different positions are different.

Previous studies either implicitly model the semantic and variation factors or ineffectively constrain the disentangling process, thus rendering the disentanglement incomplete and ineffective. In this study, we propose a novel approach, named DualVAE , to explicitly model and disentangle both the semantic and variation factors.

Fuzzy sampled controller design for consensus of multiagent networks with varying connections,2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC),T-S fuzzy models are first presented to describe multiagent networks (MANs) with varying connections. The nodes of each T-S fuzzy model are rearranged so that the global fuzzy model is decomposed into independent and small-scale fuzzy models. It is shown that the consensus of the global fuzzy model is equivalent to that of its corresponding small-scale fuzzy models in which the sampled controller is applied. A sufficient condition is derived to ensure the consensus of the sampled controlling fuzzy models.,-,153.0

Global relative input-output sensitivities of the feed-forward loops in genetic networks,Proceedings of the 31st Chinese Control Conference,"The feed-forward loops (FFLs) are fundamental network motifs with three components from gene regulatory networks to signaling transduction networks.

Based on the proposed global relative parameter sensitivities (GRPS) algorithm, this paper aims at investigating the global relative input-output sensitivities (GRIOS) of FFLs in genetic networks. The results indicate that the most frequently appeared C1 and I1 configurations are quite insensitive under various levels of inputs and also rather robust to system parameters.

Thalassemia in the United Arab Emirates: why it can be prevented but not eradicated,PloS one,"Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder that causes abnormal hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen and is made of two proteins from four α-globin genes and two β-globin genes. A defect in one or more of these genes causes thalassemia. The treatment of thalassemia mostly depends on life-long blood transfusions and removal of excessive iron from the blood stream. Such tremendous blood consumption puts pressure on the national blood stock in many countries. In particular, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), various forms of thalassemia prevention have been used and hence, the substantial reduction of the thalassemia major population has been achieved. However, the thalassemia carrier population still remains high, which leads to the potential increase in the thalassemia major population through carrier-carrier marriages. In this work, we investigate the long-term impact and efficacy of thalassemia prevention measures via mathematical modeling at a population level. To our best knowledge, this type of assessment has not been done before and there is no mathematical model that has investigated such a problem for thalassemia or any blood disorders at a population level. By using UAE data, we perform numerical simulations of our model and conduct sensitivity analysis of parameter values to see which parameter values affect most the dynamics of our model. We discover that the prevention measures can contribute to reduce the prevalence of the disease only in the short term but not eradicate the disease in the long term.",19326203,3.107

A viral load-based cellular automata approach to modeling HIV dynamics and drug treatment,Journal of theoretical biology,"We formulated a novel cellular automata (CA) model for HIV dynamics and drug treatment.

We assume that the calculation of the number of cells in the neighborhood which influences the center cell's state is based on the viral load. This variable-cell neighborhood enables the simulation of an infection rate that is correlated to the viral load.

Modeling the Impact of Unreported Cases of the COVID-19 in the North African Countries,Journal of Biological Chemistry,"Simple Summary
One of the challenges facing the countries to contain the COVID-19 is to trace people that were in contact with an infected person. Failing to identify the possible infected people leads to unreported cases of the COVID-19, which results in massive infection among the population and even superinfection events. In this work, we study the impact of the lockdown implemented by three North African countries on reducing the infections in the pandemic’s first wave. Then, we investigate the effect of the unreported cases in the increase of the number of infected people when each country relaxed the population’s mobility in the “Eid” period, resulting in the second wave of the COVID-19.
Abstract
In this paper, we study a mathematical model investigating the impact of unreported cases of the COVID-19 in three North African countries: Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco. To understand how the population respects the restriction of population mobility implemented in each country, we use Google and Apple’s mobility reports. These mobility reports help to quantify the effect of the population movement restrictions on the evolution of the active infection cases. We also approximate the number of the population infected unreported, the proportion of those that need hospitalization, and estimate the end of the epidemic wave. Moreover, we use our model to estimate the second wave of the COVID-19 Algeria and Morocco and to project the end of the second wave. Finally, we suggest some additional measures that can be considered to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 and would lead to a second wave of the spread of …","00219258, 1083351X",4.003

These models incorporate the simulating effect of the production of CTLs during the infection. The systematical analysis of these models show that the behaviors of the models are similar when CTL density is high and in which case both generate reasonable dynamics.

Agent-Based Modeling of the Hajj Rituals with the Possible Spread of COVID-19,Sustainability,"With the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continuing to spread around the globe, there is an unprecedented need to develop different approaches to containing the pandemic from spreading further. One particular case of importance is mass-gathering events. Mass-gathering events have been shown to exhibit the possibility to be superspreader events; as such, the adoption of effective control strategies by policymakers is essential to curb the spread of the pandemic. This paper deals with modeling the possible spread of COVID-19 in the Hajj, the world’s largest religious gathering. We present an agent-based model (ABM) for two rituals of the Hajj: Tawaf and Ramy al-Jamarat. The model aims to investigate the effect of two control measures: buffers and face masks.

Global stability analysis of a generalized virus dynamics model with the immune response,Canadian Applied Mathematics Quarterly,"The aim of this work is to study the global stability of a generalized model of a viral dynamic that includes the adaptive immune response, represented by Cytotoxic Lymphocyte T-cell (CTL-cell). The incidence function introduced in this model is the generalization of a variety of viral models including HIV, influenza, HBV, and HCV. We show that the global stability of this model, using the Lyapunov function, is not only characterized by the basic reproduction number but also by what is called the basic defense number, which represents the level of the infection required to trigger the CTL response. In fact, if the basic defense number is bigger than one, we prove the global stability of the CTL-active equilibrium, which represents a chronic stage of the infection, where the CTL cells could also damage the healthy cells. Otherwise, we have another equilibria that represents the early state of the infection, where the adaptive immune response is not involved yet in the clearance of the infection and only the innate immune response is active.

West Nile dynamics: virus transmission between domestic and wild bird populations through vectors,Can. Appl. Math. Quart,"A deterministic model is constructed and analyzed to study the dynamics of West Nile Virus (WNV) transmission between two bird populations—domestic and wild—through vectors (mosquitoes). Different effective contact rates are assumed between vectors and each of the two bird populations. The analysis of the model, which is based on a system of ordinary differential equations, has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number, is less than unity. The disease persists uniformly with respect to small changes in the model parameters when the reproduction number is larger than unity. Furthermore, in the later case, the model is shown to have a unique endemic equilibrium under a certain condition. Numerical simulations suggest that this endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable. Our results suggest that intervention programs aimed at the reduction of mosquito density—rather than those associated with birds—have a higher impact in controlling WNV in the two bird populations.

On the maximal output admissible set for a class of nonlinear discrete systems,Systems Analysis Modelling Simulation,"Consider the nonlinear discrete system x ( i + 1) = A ( x ( i )) x ( i ), i S 0, where A is a nonlinear map such that A ( x ) is a real matrix for every $ x \in \shadR^n $ , the output function is supposed to be y ( i ) = Cx ( i ), i S 0. Given a constraint set $ \Omega \subset \shadR^p $ , an initial state x (0) is said to be output admissible if the resulting output signal ( y ( i )) i satisfies the condition y ( i ) ] z for every integer i S 0.

Optimal control and stability analysis of an age-structured SEIRV model with imperfect vaccination,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,"Vaccination programs are crucial for reducing the prevalence of infectious diseases and ultimately eradicating them. A new age-structured SEIRV (S-Susceptible, E-Exposed, I-Infected, R-Recovered, V-Vaccinated) model with imperfect vaccination is proposed. After formulating our model, we show the existence and uniqueness of the solution using semigroup of operators. For stability analysis, we obtain a threshold parameter R0. Through rigorous analysis, we show that if R0< 1, then the disease-free equilibrium point is stable. The optimal control strategy is also discussed, with the vaccination rate as the control variable. We derive the optimality conditions, and the form of the optimal control is obtained using the adjoint system and sensitivity equations. We also prove the uniqueness of the optimal controller. To visually illustrate our theoretical results, we also solve the model numerically.","15471063, 15510018",2.404
Modelling the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 transmission from mobility maps,Infectious Disease Modelling,"The world has faced the COVID-19 pandemic for over two years now, and it is time to revisit the lessons learned from lockdown measures for theoretical and practical epidemiological improvements.

Modeling the Impact of the Imperfect Vaccination of the COVID-19 with Optimal Containment Strategy,Axioms,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination has been the main strategy to contain the spread of the coronavirus. However, with the administration of many types of vaccines and the constant mutation of viruses, the issue of how effective these vaccines are in protecting the population is raised. This work aimed to present a mathematical model that investigates the imperfect vaccine and finds the additional measures needed to help reduce the burden of disease. We determine the R 0 threshold of disease spread and use stability analysis to determine the condition that will result in disease eradication. We also fitted our model to COVID-19 data from Morocco to estimate the parameters of the model.

Optimal control of the treatment and the vaccination in an epidemic switched system using polynomial approach,Alexandria Engineering Journal,"We study the problem of optimal switching on a treatment-vaccination model with four switches. These switches provide a more realistic approach when dealing with the control of an epidemic. We have used a relatively new approach to investigate optimal switching.

This allows us to obtain an equivalent convex formulation better suited to being solved by high-performance numerical computing. Toward the end, we perform some numerical simulations and draw the conclusion that the presence of treatment is essential, whereas vaccination control can be used at intervals with progressively larger gaps between the intervals.","11100168, 20902670",7.727

Directional mobility is defined between each two cities and can take different values. The work examines the role that such mobility levels play in containing the infection with various vaccination coverage and age distributions. The results indicate that mobility reduction is sufficient to control the disease under all circumstances and full lockdowns are not a necessity. It has to be reduced to different ratios depending on the vaccination level and age distribution.

STABILITY AND ZERO-HOPF BIFURCATION ANALYSIS OF A TUMOUR AND T-HELPER CELLS INTERACTION MODEL IN THE CASE OF HIV INFECTION,Miskolc Mathematical Notes,"In this paper, we present a mathematical model governing the dynamics of tumourimmune cells interaction under HIV infection. The interactions between tumour cells, helper T-cells, infected helper T-cells and virus cells are explained by using delay differential equations including two different discrete time delays. In the model, these time lags describe the time needed by the helper T-cells to find (or recognize) tumour cells and virus, respectively. First, we analyze the dynamics of the model without delays. We prove the positivity of the solution, analyze the local and global stabilities of the steady states of the model. Second, we study the effects of two discrete time delays on the stability of the endemically infected equilibrium point. We determine the conditions on parameters at which the system undergoes a zero-Hopf bifurcation. Choosing one of the delay terms as a bifurcation parameter and fixing the other, we show that a zero-Hopf bifurcation arises as the bifurcation parameter passes through a critical value. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to support and extend our theoretical results. The results concluded help to better understand the links between the immune system and the tumour development in the case of HIV infection.","17872405, 17872413",0.96

Influences of degree inhomogeneity on average path length and random walks in disassortative scale-free networks,Journal of mathematical physics,"Various real-life networks exhibit degree correlations and heterogeneous structure, with the latter being characterized by power-law degree distribution P (k)∼ k− γ⁠, where the degree exponent γ describes the extent of heterogeneity.

Link prediction based on quantum-inspired ant colony optimization,Scientific reports,"Incomplete or partial observations of network structures pose a serious challenge to theoretical and engineering studies of real networks. To remedy the missing links in real datasets, topology-based link prediction is introduced into the studies of various networks. Due to the complexity of network structures, the accuracy and robustness of most link prediction algorithms are not satisfying enough. In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired ant colony optimization algorithm that integrates ant colony optimization and quantum computing to predict links in networks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real networks show that the accuracy and robustness of the new algorithm is competitive in respect to most of the state of the art algorithms.

Traffic fluctuations on weighted networks,IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine,"Traffic fluctuation has so far been studied on unweighted networks. However, many real traffic systems are better represented and understood as weighted networks, where nodes and links are assigned some weight values representing their physical properties such as capacity and delay. Here, we introduce a general random diffusion (GRD) model to investigate the traffic fluctuations on weighted networks, where a random walks choice of route is affected not only by the number of links a node has, but also by the weights of individual links. We obtain analytical solutions that characterize the relation between the average traffic and the fluctuations through nodes and links. Our analysis is supported by results of extensive numerical simulations. We observe that the value ranges of the average traffic and the fluctuations, through nodes or links, increase dramatically with the level of heterogeneity in link weights. This …",1531636X,3.75
Gaming temporal networks,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,"Temporal networks are composed of individuals with on-and-off interactions. In the study of human dynamics, a typical interaction is interpreted as a coincidental or forced concurrence of two events. Since human beings’ rationality is bounded, the interaction between sentient individuals is normally investigated under the framework of game theory in the past half a century. In this brief, a game model on social networks is introduced, in which individuals play a divide-and-conquer game with their neighbors, which is a specific symmetric game based on the type of their interactions. The individuals in a network play with the game with a certain strategy. The duration of a continuous interaction is defined to be the number of the continuous rounds in which at least one of them receives a non-zero payoff. On the contrary, the inter-event time is measured by the number of the continuous rounds in which both players …","15497747, 15583791",4.475
Henneberg growth of social networks: Modeling the Facebook,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,"Social networks are complex in their forming and growing processes. Tremendous empirical evidence in undirected social networks, such as Facebook, Quora and Foursquare, demonstrates that, to a large extent, individuals are associated with each other not by preference but through other organizing rules. One such rule found in many real social networks is the Henneberg growth mechanism, with which a triangle will be formed whenever an individual joins a community. Inspired by this mechanism, a novel social network model, named Henneberg growth model, is proposed in this paper. Some topological and dynamical properties of the model in common interest are analyzed. Experimental results show that the function and structure of the model are in remarkable agreement with two huge-scale Facebook network datasets.

Diffusion–annihilation processes in weighted scale-free networks with an identical degree sequence,Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment,"and diffusion–annihilation processes have so far been studied on weighted uncorrelated scale-free networks and fractal scale-free networks. In the previous reports it was widely accepted that the segregation of particles in the processes is introduced by the fractal structure. In this paper we study these processes on a family of weighted scale-free networks with an identical degree sequence. We find that the depletion zone and segregation are essentially caused by disassortative mixing, namely, high-degree nodes tend to connect with low-degree nodes. Their influence on the processes is governed by the correlation between the weight and degree. Our finding suggests that the weight and degree distribution do not suffice to characterize the diffusion–annihilation processes on weighted scale-free networks.",17425468,1.415

Unfavorable individuals in social gaming networks,Scientific reports,"In social gaming networks, the current research focus has been on the origin of widespread reciprocal behaviors when individuals play non-cooperative games. In this paper, we investigate the topological properties of unfavorable individuals in evolutionary games. The unfavorable individuals are defined as the individuals gaining the lowest average payoff in a round of game. Since the average payoff is normally considered as a measure of fitness, the unfavorable individuals are very likely to be eliminated or change their strategy updating rules from a Darwinian perspective. Considering that humans can hardly adopt a unified strategy to play with their neighbors, we propose a divide-and-conquer game model, where individuals can interact with their neighbors in the network with appropriate strategies. We test and compare a series of highly rational strategy updating rules. In the tested scenarios, our analytical …",20452322,3.883

In this paper, we investigate a divide-and-conquer tournament among 14 well-known strategies on social gaming networks. In the tournament, an individual’s fitness is measured by accumulated and average payoff aggregated for a certain number of rounds. On the base of their fitness, the evolution of the population follows a local learning mechanism.

We show that one can adjust the values of α and β to rebuild a nonzero finite epidemic threshold. Furthermore, we also find the infectivity exponent α has a stronger effect not only on the epidemic threshold, but also on the epidemic prevalence.

We integrate the constraints into the trace formulation of the sum of square Euclidean distance function of K-means.

There is a growing need to handle queries on road networks in distributed environments because a large network is typically distributed over multiple machines and it will improve query throughput. However, all the existing work on spatial keyword queries is based on a centralized setting. In this paper, we develop a distributed solution to answering spatial keyword queries on road networks. Example queries include “find locations near a supermarket and a hospital,” and “find Chinese restaurants within 500 meters from my current location.” We define an operation for answering such queries and reduce the problem of answering a query into computing a function of such operations. We propose a new distributed index that enables each machine to independently evaluate the operation on its network fragment in a distributed setting. We theoretically prove the space optimality of the proposed index technique. We conduct experiments with a distributed setting. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method.",-,153.0
Effective drug–target interaction prediction with mutual interaction neural network,Bioinformatics,"Motivation
Accurately predicting drug–target interaction (DTI) is a crucial step to drug discovery. Recently, deep learning techniques have been widely used for DTI prediction and achieved significant performance improvement. One challenge in building deep learning models for DTI prediction is how to appropriately represent drugs and targets. Target distance map and molecular graph are low dimensional and informative representations, which however have not been jointly used in DTI prediction. Another challenge is how to effectively model the mutual impact between drugs and targets. Though attention mechanism has been used to capture the one-way impact of targets on drugs or vice versa, the mutual impact between drugs and targets has not yet been explored, which is very important in predicting their interactions.

A new and effective hierarchical overlay structure for peer-to-peer networks,Computer Communications,"The tremendous growth of public interest in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks in recent years has initiated a lot of research work on how to design efficient overlay structures for P2P systems. Scalable overlay networks such as Chord, CAN, Pastry, and Tapestry provide no control over where data is stored and the location of the peers and resources is determined by the hash values of their identifiers and keys respectively. As a result, these overlays cannot support range queries and other proximity-aware complex queries directly. In this paper, we present a hierarchical P2P overlay network called SkipCluster, which is capable of supporting both exact-match and multi-dimensional range queries efficiently without consumption of extra memory space. SkipCluster is derived from skip graphs and SkipNet, but it has a two-tier hierarchical architecture.In both tiers, peers are connected in sequence according to the order of …","01403664, 1873703X",5.717
A comparison study on feature selection of DNA structural properties for promoter prediction,BMC bioinformatics,"Background
Promoter prediction is an integrant step for understanding gene regulation and annotating genomes. Traditional promoter analysis is mainly based on sequence compositional features. Recently, many kinds of structural features have been employed in promoter prediction. However, considering the high-dimensionality and overfitting problems, it is unfeasible to utilize all available features for promoter prediction. Thus it is necessary to choose some appropriate features for the prediction task.

Firstly, to examine whether promoters possess some special structures, we carry out a systematical comparison among the profiles of thirteen structural features on promoter and non-promoter sequences. Secondly, we …",14712105,3.067
Mean first-passage time for random walks on the T-graph,New Journal of Physics,"For random walks on networks (graphs), it is a theoretical challenge to explicitly determine the mean first-passage time (MFPT) between two nodes averaged over all pairs. In this paper, we study the MFPT of random walks using the famous T-graph, linking this important quantity to the resistance distance in electronic networks. We obtain an exact formula for the MFPT that is confirmed by extensive numerical calculations. This interesting quantity is derived through the recurrence relations resulting from the self-similar structure of the T-graph. The obtained closed-form expression shows that the MFPT increases approximately as a power-law function of the number of nodes, with the exponent lying between 1 and 2. Our research may further a deeper understanding of random walks on the T-graph.",13672630,2.844

Fusing multiple protein-protein similarity networks to effectively predict lncRNA-protein interactions,BMC bioinformatics,"Background
Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays important roles in many biological and pathological processes, including transcriptional regulation and gene regulation. As lncRNA interacts with multiple proteins, predicting lncRNA-protein interactions (lncRPIs) is an important way to study the functions of lncRNA. Up to now, there have been a few works that exploit protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to help the prediction of new lncRPIs.

Effectively classifying short texts by structured sparse representation with dictionary filtering,Information Sciences,"Short text classification (STC) has attracted increasing interest recently with the rapid growth of Web and social media data existing in short text form. It is a more challenging task than traditional text classification (TC) because of the feature sparsity of the processed short texts, which makes the state of the art TC approaches perform poorly on short texts if being applied straightforwardly. Existing STC approaches deal with the sparse problem mainly by enriching text content with outer corpora or additional information. Though better performance can be obtained, the performance heavily relies on the amount and quality of outer or additional information. What is worse, such outer or additional information is not always available, not to mention the high cost for acquiring such information. In this paper, we introduce a structured sparse representation classifier to effectively classify short texts, and develop an effective …",00200255,7.887

Causal discovery using regression-based conditional independence tests,Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence,"Conditional independence (CI) testing is an important tool in causal discovery. Generally, by using CI tests, a set of Markov equivalence classes wrt the observed data can be estimated by checking whether each pair of variables x and y is d-separated, given a set of variables Z. Due to the curse of dimensionality, CI testing is often difficult to return a reliable result for high-dimensional Z. In this paper, we propose a regression-based CI test to relax the test of x⊥ y| Z to simpler unconditional independence tests of x− f (Z)⊥ y− g (Z), and x− f (Z)⊥ Z or y− g (Z)⊥ Z under the assumption that the data-generating procedure follows additive noise models (ANMs). When the ANM is identifiable, we prove that x− f (Z)⊥ y− g (Z)⇒ x⊥ y| Z. We also show that 1) f and g can be easily estimated by regression, 2) our test is more powerful than the state-of-the-art kernel CI tests, and 3) existing causal learning algorithms can infer much more causal directions by using the proposed method.",-,153.0
A new unsupervised binning approach for metagenomic sequences based on n-grams and automatic feature weighting,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,"The rapid development of high-throughput technologies enables researchers to sequence the whole metagenome of a microbial community sampled directly from the environment. The assignment of these sequence reads into different species or taxonomical classes is a crucial step for metagenomic analysis, which is referred to as binning of metagenomic data. Most traditional binning methods rely on known reference genomes for accurate assignment of the sequence reads, therefore cannot classify reads from unknown species without the help of close references. To overcome this drawback, unsupervised learning based approaches have been proposed, which need not any known species’ reference genome for help. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method called MCluster for binning metagenomic sequences.

Selecting high-quality negative samples for effectively predicting protein-RNA interactions,BMC systems biology,"Background
The identification of Protein-RNA Interactions (PRIs) is important to understanding cell activities. Recently, several machine learning-based methods have been developed for identifying PRIs. However, the performance of these methods is unsatisfactory. One major reason is that they usually use unreliable negative samples in the training process.

For boosting the performance of PRI prediction, we propose a novel method to generate reliable negative samples. Concretely, we firstly collect the known PRIs as positive samples for generating positive sets. For each positive set, we construct two corresponding negative sets, one is by our method and the other by random method. Each positive set is combined with a negative set to form a dataset for model training and performance evaluation. Consequently, we get 18 datasets of …",17520509,0.0

A general framework for unmet demand prediction in on-demand transport services,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Emerging on-demand transport services, such as Uber and GoGoVan, usually face the dilemma of demand supply imbalance, meaning that the spatial distributions of orders and drivers are imbalanced. Due to such imbalance, much supply resource is wasted while a considerable amount of order demand cannot be met in time. To address this dilemma, knowing the unmet demand in the near future is of high importance for service providers because they can dispatch their vehicles in advance to alleviate the impending demand supply imbalance, we develop a general framework for predicting the unmet demand in future time slots.

Protein function prediction based on PPI networks: network reconstruction vs edge enrichment,Frontiers in Genetics,"Over the past decades, massive amounts of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data have been accumulated due to the advancement of high-throughput technologies, and but data quality issues (noise or incompleteness) of PPI have been still affecting protein function prediction accuracy based on PPI networks. Although two main strategies of network reconstruction and edge enrichment have been reported on the effectiveness of boosting the prediction performance in numerous literature studies, there still lack comparative studies of the performance differences between network reconstruction and edge enrichment. Inspired by the question, this study first uses three protein similarity metrics (local, global and sequence) for network reconstruction and edge enrichment in PPI networks, and then evaluates the performance differences of network reconstruction, edge enrichment and the original networks on two real PPI datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that edge enrichment work better than both network reconstruction and original networks. Moreover, for the edge enrichment of PPI networks, the sequence similarity outperformes both local and global similarity. In summary, our study can help biologists select suitable pre-processing schemes and achieve better protein function prediction for PPI networks.",16648021,2.733

In this paper, we presented a novel molecular representation method and developed a corresponding deep learning-based framework called TOP (the abbreviation of TOxicity Prediction). TOP integrates specifically designed data preprocessing methods, an RNN based on bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), and fully connected neural networks for end-to-end molecular representation learning and chemical toxicity prediction. TOP can automatically learn a mixed molecular representation from not only SMILES contextual information that describes the molecule structure, but also physiochemical properties. Therefore, TOP can overcome the drawbacks of existing methods that use either of them, thus greatly promotes toxicity prediction accuracy. We conducted …","10462023, 10959130",4.15
Learning competitive and discriminative reconstructions for anomaly detection,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"Most of the existing methods for anomaly detection use only positive data to learn the data distribution, thus they usually need a pre-defined threshold at the detection stage to determine whether a test instance is an outlier. Unfortunately, a good threshold is vital for the performance and it is really hard to find an optimal one. In this paper, we take the discriminative information implied in unlabeled data into consideration and propose a new method for anomaly detection that can learn the labels of unlabelled data directly. Our proposed method has an end-to-end architecture with one encoder and two decoders that are trained to model inliers and outliers’ data distributions in a competitive way. This architecture works in a discriminative manner without suffering from overfitting, and the training algorithm of our model is adopted from SGD, thus it is efficient and scalable even for large-scale datasets. Empirical studies on 7 datasets including KDD99, MNIST, Caltech-256, and ImageNet etc. show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",-,153.0
Predicting enhancers from multiple cell lines and tissues across different developmental stages based on SVM method,Current Bioinformatics,"Background
Enhancers are short DNA regions that improve transcription efficiency by recruiting transcription factors. Identifying enhancer regions is important to understand the process of gene expression. As enhancers are independent of their distances and orientations to the target genes, it is difficult to locate enhancers accurately. Recently, with the development of highthroughput ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing) technologies, several computational methods were developed to predict enhancers. However, most of these methods rely on p300 binding sites and/or DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) for selecting positive training samples, which is imprecise and subsequently leads to unsatisfactory prediction performance. Besides, in the literature, there is no work that predicts enhancers from tissues across different developmental stages.

Denoising protein–protein interaction network via variational graph auto-encoder for protein complex detection,Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,"Identifying protein complexes is an important issue in computational biology, as it benefits the understanding of cellular functions and the design of drugs. In the past decades, many computational methods have been proposed by mining dense subgraphs in Protein–Protein Interaction Networks (PINs). However, the high rate of false positive/negative interactions in PINs prevents accurately detecting complexes directly from the raw PINs. In this paper, we propose a denoising approach for protein complex detection by using variational graph auto-encoder. First, we embed a PIN to vector space by a stacked graph convolutional network (GCN), then decide which interactions in the PIN are credible. If the probability of an interaction being credible is less than a threshold, we delete the interaction. In such a way, we reconstruct a reliable PIN. Following that, we detect protein complexes in the reconstructed PIN by using …","02197200, 17576334",0.84

Scalable continual top-k keyword search in relational databases,Data & Knowledge Engineering,"Keyword search in relational databases has been widely studied in recent years because it requires users neither to master a certain structured query language nor to know the complex underlying database schemas. Most of the existing methods focus on answering snapshot keyword queries in static databases. In reality, however, databases are updated frequently, and users may have long-term interests in specific topics. To deal with such a situation, it is necessary to build an effective and efficient facility in a database system to support continual keyword queries.

Average distance in a hierarchical scale-free network: an exact solution,Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment,"Various real systems simultaneously exhibit scale-free and hierarchical structure. In this paper, we study analytically average distance in a deterministic scale-free network with hierarchical organization. Using a recursive method based on the network construction, we determine explicitly the average distance, obtaining an exact expression for it, which is confirmed by extensive numerical calculations. The rigorous solution obtained shows that the average distance grows logarithmically with the network order (number of nodes in the network). We show the similarity and dissimilarity in average distance between the network under consideration and some previously studied networks, including random networks and other deterministic networks. On the basis of the comparison, we argue that the logarithmic scaling of average distance with network order could be a generic feature of deterministic scale-free networks.",17425468,1.415

Computationally identifying hot spots in protein-DNA binding interfaces using an ensemble approach,BMC bioinformatics,"Background
Protein-DNA interaction governs a large number of cellular processes, and it can be altered by a small fraction of interface residues, i.e., the so-called hot spots, which account for most of the interface binding free energy. Accurate prediction of hot spots is critical to understand the principle of protein-DNA interactions. There are already some computational methods that can accurately and efficiently predict a large number of hot residues. However, the insufficiency of experimentally validated hot-spot residues in protein-DNA complexes and the low diversity of the employed features limit the performance of existing methods.

Effectively predicting protein complexes not only helps to understand the structures and functions of proteins and their complexes, but also is useful for diagnosing disease and developing new drugs.

DCAD: a dual clustering algorithm for distributed spatial databases,Geo-spatial Information Science,"Spatial objects have two types of attributes: geometrical attributes and non-geometrical attributes, which belong to two different attribute domains (geometrical and non-geometrical domains). Although geometrically scattered in a geometrical domain, spatial objects may be similar to each other in a non-geometrical domain. Most existing clustering algorithms group spatial datasets into different compact regions in a geometrical domain without considering the aspect of a non-geometrical domain. However, many application scenarios require clustering results in which a cluster has not only high proximity in a geometrical domain, but also high similarity in a non-geometrical domain. This means constraints are imposed on the clustering goal from both geometrical and non-geometrical domains simultaneously. Such a clustering problem is called dual clustering.

This paper presents a new pattern-based subspace clustering method, which can tackle the problems mentioned above.

MIMO: A unified spatio-temporal model for multi-scale sea surface temperature prediction,Remote Sensing,"Sea surface temperature (SST) is a crucial factor that affects global climate and marine activities. Predicting SST at different temporal scales benefits various applications, from short-term SST prediction for weather forecasting to long-term SST prediction for analyzing El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, existing approaches for SST prediction train separate models for different temporal scales, which is inefficient and cannot take advantage of the correlations among the temperatures of different scales to improve the prediction performance. In this work, we propose a unified spatio-temporal model termed the Multi-In and Multi-Out (MIMO) model to predict SST at different scales. MIMO is an encoder–decoder model, where the encoder learns spatio-temporal features from the SST data of multiple scales, and fuses the learned features with a Cross Scale Fusion (CSF) operation. The decoder utilizes the learned features from the encoder to adaptively predict the SST of different scales. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to predict SST at different temporal scales simultaneously with a single model. According to the experimental evaluation on the Optimum Interpolation SST (OISST) dataset, MIMO achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performance.",20724292,4.547
Learning causal structures based on divide and conquer,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,"This article addresses two important issues of causal inference in the high-dimensional situation. One is how to reduce redundant conditional independence (CI) tests, which heavily impact the efficiency and accuracy of existing constraint-based methods. Another is how to construct the true causal graph from a set of Markov equivalence classes returned by these methods. For the first issue, we design a recursive decomposition approach where the original data (a set of variables) are first decomposed into two small subsets, each of which is then recursively decomposed into two smaller subsets until none of these subsets can be decomposed further. Redundant CI tests can be reduced by inferring causalities from these subsets. The advantage of this decomposition scheme lies in two aspects: 1) it requires only low-order CI tests and 2) it does not violate -separation. The complete causality can be reconstructed by merging all …","21682267, 21682275",10.595
DEEPSEN: a convolutional neural network based method for super-enhancer prediction,BMC bioinformatics,"Background
Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of transcriptional active enhancers, which dictate the expression of genes defining cell identity and play an important role in the development and progression of tumors and other diseases.

Therefore, this paper proposes a unified framework to fuse the data collected from different domains to predict multiple KPIs for on-demand transport services.

Measuring conditional independence by independent residuals: theoretical results and application in causal discovery,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"We investigate the relationship between conditional independence (CI) x⊥ y| Z and the independence of two residuals x–E (x| Z)⊥–E (y| Z), where x and y are two random variables, and Z is a set of random variables. We show that if x, y and Z are generated by following linear structural equation model and all external influences follow Gaussian distributions, then x⊥ y| Z if and only if x–E (x| Z)⊥ y–E (y| Z). That is, the test of x⊥ y| Z can be relaxed to a simpler unconditional independence test of x–E (x| Z)⊥ y–E (y| Z). Furthermore, if all these external influences follow non-Gaussian distributions and the model satisfies structural faithfulness condition, then we have x⊥ y| Z⇔ x–E (x| Z)⊥ y–E (y| Z). We apply the results above to the causal discovery problem, where the causal directions are generally determined by a set of V-structures and their consistent propagations, so CI test-based methods can return a set of Markov equivalence classes. We show that in linear non-Gaussian context, x–E (x| Z)⊥ y–E (y| Z)⇒ x–E (x| Z)⊥ z or y–E (y| Z⊥ z (∀ z∈ Z) if Z is a minimal d-separator, which implies z causes x (or y) if z directly connects to x (or y). Therefore, we conclude that CIs have useful information for distinguishing Markov equivalence classes. In summary, compared with the existing discretization-based and kernel-based CI testing methods, the proposed method provides a simpler way to measure CI, which needs only one unconditional independence test and two regression operations. When being applied to causal discovery, it can find more causal relationships, which is experimentally validated.",-,153.0

Testing independence between linear combinations for causal discovery,Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence,"Recently, regression based conditional independence (CI) tests have been employed to solve the problem of causal discovery.

In this paper, we investigate the independence between two linear combinations under linear non-Gaussian structural equation model (SEM). We show that generally the 1-st to 4-th moments of the two linear combinations contain enough information to infer whether or not they are independent. The proposed method provides a simpler but more effective way to measure CIs, with only calculating the 1-st to 4-th moments of the input variables.

Group-sparse modeling drug-kinase networks for predicting combinatorial drug sensitivity in cancer cells,Current Bioinformatics,"Background
Due to the intrinsic compensatory mechanism and cross-talks mong cellular signaling pathways, single-target drugs often fail to inhibit the survival pathways in cancer cells. Some multi-target combination drugs have demonstrated their high sensitivities and low side effects in cancer therapies, and thus drawn intensive attentions from researchers and pharmaceutical enterprises.

Residual similarity based conditional independence test and its application in causal discovery,Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence,"Recently, many regression based conditional independence (CI) test methods have been proposed to solve the problem of causal discovery. These methods provide alternatives to test CI by first removing the information of the controlling set from the two target variables, and then testing the independence between the corresponding residuals Res1 and Res2. When the residuals are linearly uncorrelated, the independence test between them is nontrivial. With the ability to calculate inner product in high-dimensional space, kernel-based methods are usually used to achieve this goal, but still consume considerable time. In this paper, we investigate the independence between two linear combinations under linear non-Gaussian structural equation model. We show that the dependence between the two residuals can be captured by the difference between the similarity of (Res1, Res2) and that of (Res1, Res3)(Res3 is generated by random permutation) in high-dimensional space. With this result, we design a new method called SCIT for CI test, where permutation test is performed to control Type I error rate. The proposed method is simpler yet more efficient and effective than the existing ones. When applied to causal discovery, the proposed method outperforms the counterparts in terms of both speed and Type II error rate, especially in the case of small sample size, which is validated by our extensive experiments on various datasets.",-,153.0
STA-GAN: a spatio-temporal attention generative adversarial network for missing value imputation in satellite data,Remote Sensing,"Satellite data is of high importance for ocean environment monitoring and protection. However, due to the missing values in satellite data, caused by various force majeure factors such as cloud cover, bad weather and sensor failure, the quality of satellite data is reduced greatly, which hinders the applications of satellite data in practice. Therefore, a variety of methods have been proposed to conduct missing data imputation for satellite data to improve its quality. However, these methods cannot well learn the short-term temporal dependence and dynamic spatial dependence in satellite data, resulting in bad imputation performance when the data missing rate is large. To address this issue, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Attention Generative Adversarial Network (STA-GAN) for missing value imputation in satellite data. First, we develop the Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism based on Graph Attention Network (GAT) to learn features for capturing both short-term temporal dependence and dynamic spatial dependence in satellite data. Then, the learned features from STA are fused to enrich the spatio-temporal information for training the generator and discriminator of STA-GAN. Finally, we use the generated imputation data by the trained generator of STA-GAN to fill the missing values in satellite data. Experimental results on real datasets show that STA-GAN largely outperforms the baseline data imputation methods, especially for filling satellite data with large missing rates.",20724292,4.547
Efficient retrieval of bounded-cost informative routes,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,"The widespread location-aware applications produce a vast amount of spatio-textual data that contains both spatial and textual attributes. To make use of this enriched information for users to describe their preferences for travel routes, we propose a Bounded-Cost Informative Route (BCIR) query to retrieve the routes that are the most textually relevant to the user-specified query keywords subject to a travel cost constraint. BCIR query is particularly helpful for tourists and city explorers to plan their travel routes. We will show that BCIR query is an NP-hard problem. To answer BCIR query efficiently, we propose an exact solution with effective pruning techniques and two approximate solutions with performance guarantees.

LAYER: A cost-efficient mechanism to support multi-tenant database as a service in cloud,Journal of Systems and Software,"This paper presents a novel mechanism to cost-efficiently support multi-tenant database as a service (MTDBaaS) in cloud for small businesses. We aim at the scenarios where a large number of small tenants are served but only some of them are active simultaneously. By small tenants, we mean that a tenant may have many small-sized tables while only a small number of those tables are accessed concurrently for each query. As most MTDBaaS providers, we consolidate multiple tenants’ data into the same database management system (DBMS) to reduce the cost of operation. However, our solution distinguishes itself from the existing solutions by a novel mechanism: Load As You quERy (LAYER in short). Concretely, tenants can define and create their own tables with LAYER, and set up possible reference constraints between any two tables.

We present an exhaustive analysis of various properties of our model, and obtain the analytic solutions for most of the features, including degree distribution, clustering coefficient, average path length and degree correlations. The model recovers some striking generic characteristics observed in most real networks. To address the robustness of the relevant network properties, we compare the structural features between the investigated network and the Apollonian networks. We show that topological properties of the two networks are encoded in the way of disk packing. We argue that spatial …",13672630,2.844

Self-supervised learning with chemistry-aware fragmentation for effective molecular property prediction,Briefings in Bioinformatics,"Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a crucial and fundamental task for AI-aided drug discovery (AIDD). Recent studies have shown great promise of applying self-supervised learning (SSL) to producing molecular representations to cope with the widely-concerned data scarcity problem in AIDD. As some specific substructures of molecules play important roles in determining molecular properties, molecular representations learned by deep learning models are expected to attach more importance to such substructures implicitly or explicitly to achieve better predictive performance.

"Network as regularization for training deep neural networks: framework, model and performance",Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"Despite powerful representation ability, deep neural networks (DNNs) are prone to over-fitting, because of over-parametrization. Existing works have explored various regularization techniques to tackle the over-fitting problem. Some of them employed soft targets rather than one-hot labels to guide network training (eg label smoothing in classification tasks), which are called target-based regularization approaches in this paper. To alleviate the over-fitting problem, here we propose a new and general regularization framework that introduces an auxiliary network to dynamically incorporate guided semantic disturbance to the labels. We call it Network as Regularization (NaR in short). During training, the disturbance is constructed by a convex combination of the predictions of the target network and the auxiliary network. These two networks are initialized separately. And the auxiliary network is trained independently from the target network, while providing instance-level and class-level semantic information to the latter progressively. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that NaR outperforms many state-of-the-art target-based regularization methods, and other regularization approaches (eg mixup) can also benefit from combining with NaR.",-,153.0

HiGRN: a hierarchical graph recurrent network for global sea surface temperature prediction,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,"Sea surface temperature (SST) is one critical parameter of global climate change, and accurate SST prediction is important to various applications, e.g., weather forecasting, fishing directions, and disaster warnings. The global ocean system is unified and complex, and the SST patterns in different oceanic regions are highly diverse and correlated. However, existing data-driven SST prediction methods mainly consider the local patterns within a certain oceanic region, e.g., El Nino region and the Black sea. It is challenging but necessary to model the global SST correlations rather than that in a specific region to enhance the prediction accuracy of SST.

Boosting scRNA-seq data clustering by cluster-aware feature weighting,BMC bioinformatics,"Background
The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the exploration of cell heterogeneity, which is usually done by scRNA-seq data clustering.

Querying Distributed Geographic Information Based on Mobile Agent,Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University,"As a recently developed paradigm in distributed computing, mobile agent can especially benefit (mobile) Internet applications on providing asynchronous task execution and more dynamics, supporting flexible and extensible cooperation, reducing communication bandwidth, enhancing real time abilities and higher degree of robustness, enabling off-line processing and disconnected operation. This paper presents an approach based on mobile agent to query distributed geographic information, which can overcome the drawbacks of the traditional connection-based access method. A prototype is implemented to access distributed geographic information transparently by using Aglets, which is a free mobile agent development platform developed by IBM. In our on-going research project, mobile agents are responsible for remote information retrieval. A user submits spatial or nonspatial query through a GUI interface built at the client machine, and the query is analyzed and decomposed at a server site. Then some mobile agents are created and dispatched to the respective sites to retrieve data autonomously and separately. Distributed GIS based on mobile agent is more adaptable to the open, heterogeneous, autonomous (mobile) Internet with limited bandwidth and unstable communication connectivity.",16718860,1.426
Molecular property prediction based on graph structure learning,Bioinformatics,"Motivation
Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a fundamental but challenging task in the computer-aided drug discovery process. More and more recent works employ different graph-based models for MPP, which have achieved considerable progress in improving prediction performance. However, current models often ignore relationships between molecules, which could be also helpful for MPP.
Results
For this sake, in this article we propose a graph structure learning (GSL) based MPP approach, called GSL-MPP. Specifically, we first apply graph neural network (GNN) over molecular graphs to extract molecular representations. Then, with molecular fingerprints, we construct a molecule similarity graph (MSG). Following that, we conduct GSL on the MSG, i.e. molecule-level GSL, to get the final molecular embeddings, which are the results of fuzing both GNN encoded …","13674803, 13674811",4.602
Molecular property prediction by semantic-invariant contrastive learning,Bioinformatics,"Motivation
Contrastive learning has been widely used as pretext tasks for self-supervised pre-trained molecular representation learning models in AI-aided drug design and discovery. However, existing methods that generate molecular views by noise-adding operations for contrastive learning may face the semantic inconsistency problem, which leads to false positive pairs and consequently poor prediction performance.

To address this problem, in this article, we first propose a semantic-invariant view generation method by properly breaking molecular graphs into fragment pairs. Then, we develop a Fragment-based Semantic-Invariant Contrastive Learning (FraSICL) model based on this view generation method for molecular property prediction. The FraSICL model consists of two branches to generate representations of views for contrastive learning, meanwhile a multi …","13674803, 13674811",4.602
Auxiliary Decision-Making System for Steel Plate Cold Straightening Based on Multi-Machine Learning Competition Strategies,Applied Sciences,"In the process of steel plate production, whether cold straightening is required is significant to reduce costs and improve product qualification rates. It is not effective by adopting classic machine learning judgment algorithms. Concerning the effectiveness of ensemble learning methods on improving traditional machine learning methods, a steel plate cold straightening auxiliary decision-making algorithm based on multiple machine learning competition strategies is proposed in this paper. The algorithm firstly adopts the rough set method to simplify the attributes of the conditional factors for affecting whether the steel plate cold straightening is required, and reduce the attribute dimensions of the steel plate cold straightening auxiliary decision-making data set. Secondly, the competition of training multiple different learners on the data set produces the optimal base classifier. Finally, the final classifier is generated by training weights on the optimal base classifier and combining it with a centralized strategy. While the hit rate of good products of the final classifier is 97.9%, the hit rate of defective products is 90.9%. As such, the accuracy rate is better than the single kind of simple machine learning algorithms, which effectively improves the product quality of steel plates in practical production applications.",14545101,0.2

Two heuristic algorithms (one is centralized and the other is distributed) are developed for constructing such backbone. The centralized algorithm, executed at the base station, is to find an optimal backbone by using the information of all nodes and links in the network.

Weakly Supervised Few-Shot Object Detection with DETR,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"In recent years, Few-shot Object Detection (FSOD) has become an increasingly important research topic in computer vision. However, existing FSOD methods require strong annotations including category labels and bounding boxes, and their performance is heavily dependent on the quality of box annotations. However, acquiring strong annotations is both expensive and time-consuming. This inspires the study on weakly supervised FSOD (WS-FSOD in short), which realizes FSOD with only image-level annotations, i.e., category labels. In this paper, we propose a new and effective weakly supervised FSOD method named WFS-DETR. By a well-designed pretraining process, WFS-DETR first acquires general object localization and integrity judgment capabilities on large-scale pretraining data. Then, it introduces object integrity into multiple-instance learning to solve the common local optimum problem by comprehensively exploiting both semantic and visual information. Finally, with simple fine-tuning, it transfers the knowledge learned from the base classes to the novel classes, which enables accurate detection of novel objects. Benefiting from this ``pretraining-refinement'' mechanism, WSF-DETR can achieve good generalization on different datasets. Extensive experiments also show that the proposed method clearly outperforms the existing counterparts in the WS-FSOD task.",-,153.0

MuSTC: A Multi-Stage Spatio–Temporal Clustering Method for Uncovering the Regionality of Global SST,Atmosphere,"Sea Surface Temperature (SST) prediction is a hot topic that has received tremendous popularity in recent years. Existing methods for SST prediction usually select one sea area of interest and conduct SST prediction by learning the spatial and temporal dependencies and patterns in historical SST data. However, global SST is a unified system of high regionality, and the SST in different sea areas shows different changing patterns due to the influence of various factors, e.g., geographic location, ocean currents and sea depth. Without a good understanding of such regionality of SST, we cannot quantitatively integrate the regionality information of SST into SST prediction models to make them adaptive to different SST patterns around the world and improve the prediction accuracy. To address this issue, we proposed the Multi-Stage Spatio–Temporal Clustering (MuSTC) method to quantitatively identify sea areas with similar SST patterns. First, MuSTC sequentially learns the representation of long-term SST with a deep temporal encoder and calculates the spatial correlation scores between grid ocean regions with self-attention. Then, MuSTC clusters grid ocean regions based on the original SST data, encoded long-term SST representation and spatial correlation scores, respectively, to obtain the sea areas with similar SST patterns from different perspectives. According to the experiments in three ocean areas, i.e., the North Pacific Ocean (NPO), the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) and the North Atlantic Ocean (NAO), the clustering results generally match the distribution of ocean currents, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our MuSTC method.

Conditional independence test based on residual similarity,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data,"Recently, many regression-based conditional independence (CI) test methods have been proposed to solve the problem of causal discovery. These methods provide alternatives to test CI of x,y given Z by first removing the information of the controlling set Z from x and y, and then testing the independence between the two residuals Rx,Z and Ry,Z. When the residuals are linearly uncorrelated, the independence test between them is nontrivial. With the ability to calculate inner product in high-dimensional space, kernel-based methods are usually used to achieve this goal, but they are considerably time-consuming. In this paper, we test the independence between two linear combinations under linear structural equation model. We show that the dependence between the two residuals can be captured by the difference between the similarity of Rx,Z and Ry,Z and that of Rx,Z and Rr (Rr is an independent copy of Ry,Z) in …",15564681,5.041

We show that the empirical estimate of MWMC converges exponentially to its population quantity. To support independence test better with MWMC, we further design a permutation test based on MWMC and prove that our test can not only control the type I error rate (the rate of false positives) well but also ensure that the type II error rate (the rate of false negatives) is upper bounded by O (1/n)(n is the sample size) with finite permutations.

On Evaluating the Predictability of Sea Surface Temperature Using Entropy,Remote Sensing,"Sea surface temperature (SST) has important impacts on the global ecology, and having a good understanding of the predictability, i.e., the possibility of achieving accurate prediction, of SST can help us monitor the marine environment and climate change, and guide the selection and design of SST prediction methods. However, existing studies for analyzing SST mostly measure the rising or falling trends of SST. To address this issue, we introduce a temporal-correlated entropy to quantify the predictability of SST series from both global coarse-grained and local fine-grained aspects, and make SST prediction with multiple deep learning models to prove the effectiveness of such predictability evaluation method. In addition, we explore the dynamics of SST predictability by dividing the time range of interest into consecutive time periods, evaluating the corresponding predictability of SST for each time period, and analyzing the stability of the predictability of SST over time. According to the experiments, the SST predictability values near the poles and equator are really high. The average SST predictability values of the East China Sea, Bohai Sea, and Antarctic Ocean are 0.719, 0.706, and 0.886, respectively, and the size relationship of the SST predictability in the three local sea areas is consistent with our prediction results using multiple representative SST prediction methods, which corroborates the reliability of the predictability evaluation method. In addition, we found that the SST predictability in the Antarctic Ocean changes more dramatically over time than in the East China Sea and the Bohai Sea.

In this work, we transform causal partitioning into an alternative problem that can be more easily solved. Concretely, we first construct a superstructure of the true causal graph by performing a set of low-order CI tests on the observed data . Then, we leverage point-line duality to obtain a graph adjoint to . We show that the solution of minimizing edge-cut ratio on can lead to a valid causal partitioning with smaller causal-cut ratio on and without violating -separation .

Prediction of Disk Failure Based on Classification Intensity Resampling,Information,"With the rapid growth of the data scale in data centers, the high reliability of storage is facing various challenges. Specifically, hardware failures such as disk faults occur frequently, causing serious system availability issues. In this context, hardware fault prediction based on AI and big data technologies has become a research hotspot, aiming to guide operation and maintenance personnel to implement preventive replacement through accurate prediction to reduce hardware failure rates. However, existing methods still have weaknesses in terms of accuracy due to the impacts of data quality issues such as the sample imbalance. This article proposes a disk fault prediction method based on classification intensity resampling, which fills the gap between the degree of data imbalance and the actual classification intensity of the task by introducing a base classifier to calculate the classification intensity, thus better preserving the data features of the original dataset. In addition, using ensemble learning methods such as random forests, combined with resampling, an integrated classifier for imbalanced data is developed to further improve the prediction accuracy. Experimental verification shows that compared with traditional methods, the F1-score of disk fault prediction is improved by 6%, and the model training time is also greatly reduced. The fault prediction method proposed in this paper has been applied to approximately 80 disk drives and nearly 40,000 disks in the production environment of a large bank’s data center to guide preventive replacements. Compared to traditional methods, the number of preventive replacements based on our method …",10495258,51317.0
Fault Location Method Based on Dynamic Operation and Maintenance Map and Common Alarm Points Analysis,Algorithms,"Under a distributed information system, the scale of various operational components such as applications, operating systems, databases, servers, and networks is immense, with intricate access relationships. The silo effect of each professional is prominent, and the linkage mechanism is insufficient, making it difficult to locate the infrastructure components that cause exceptions under a particular application. Current research only plays a role in local scenarios, and its accuracy and generalization are still very limited. This paper proposes a novel fault location method based on dynamic operation maps and alarm common point analysis. During the fault period, various alarm entities are associated with dynamic operation maps, and alarm common points are obtained based on graph search addressing methods, covering deployment relationship common points, connection common points (physical and logical), and access flow common points. This method, compared with knowledge graph approaches, eliminates the complex process of knowledge graph construction, making it more concise and efficient. Furthermore, in contrast to indicator correlation analysis methods, this approach supplements with configuration correlation information, resulting in more precise positioning. Through practical validation, its fault hit rate exceeds 82%, which is significantly better than the existing main methods.",19994893,2.39
Weakly Correlated Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: New Dataset and Topic-oriented Model,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Existing multimodal sentiment analysis models focus more on fusing highly correlated image-text pairs, and thus achieves unsatisfactory performance on multimodal social media data which usually manifests weak correlations between different modalities. To address this issue, we first build a large multimodal social media sentiment analysis dataset RU-Senti which contains more than 100,000 image-text pairs with sentiment labels. Then, we proposed a topic-oriented model (TOM) which assumes that text is usually related to a certain portion of the image contents and significant variances exist in sentiment distribution across diverse topics. TOM learns the topic information from textual content and designs a topic-oriented feature alignment module to extract textual semantics correlated information from images, thus achieving the alignment between two modalities.

Learning Adaptive Kernels for Statistical Independence Tests,International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,"We propose a novel framework for kernel-based statistical independence tests that enable adaptatively learning parameterized kernels to maximize test power. Our framework can effectively address the pitfall inherent in the existing signal-to-noise ratio criterion by modeling the change of the null distribution during the learning process. Based on the proposed framework, we design a new class of kernels that can adaptatively focus on the significant dimensions of variables to judge independence, which makes the tests more flexible than using simple kernels that are adaptive only in length-scale, and especially suitable for high-dimensional complex data. Theoretically, we demonstrate the consistency of our independence tests, and show that the non-convex objective function used for learning fits the L-smoothing condition, thus benefiting the optimization. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data show the superiority of our method. The source code and datasets are available at\url {https://github. com/renyixin666/HSIC-LK. git}.",-,153.0
Indicator Fault Detection Method Based on Periodic Self Discovery and Historical Anomaly Filtering,IEEE Access,"Data centers’ information systems typically encompass a variety of operational objects including applications, systems, networks, and devices, which generate a large volume of indicator data during operation. The traditional threshold-based indicator fault detection method has struggled to adapt to the massive and heterogeneous nature of distributed architectures, resulting in numerous false positives and negatives. Existing research has limitations in terms of the accuracy of fitting indicator operating characteristics, as well as performance. To address the problem of fault detection for indicator data, this article proposes a method based on periodic self-discovery and historical anomaly filtering.

A new and effective two-step clustering approach for single cell RNA sequencing data,BMC genomics,"Background
The rapid devolvement of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology leads to huge amounts of scRNA-seq data, which greatly advance the research of many biomedical fields involving tissue heterogeneity, pathogenesis of disease and drug resistance etc. One major task in scRNA-seq data analysis is to cluster cells in terms of their expression characteristics.

Learning Meta-Stable State Transition Representation of Brain Function for ADHD Identification,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children with complex onset symptoms, and brain function analysis is a helpful way to assist in diagnosis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed that the brain function activity pattern in the resting state is also dynamically changing, that is, there is a meta-stable state transition within the period of acquisition time, which is related to neurological diseases. However, existing studies neglect to mine such state transition pattern information for better disease identification. Here, we propose an end-to-end method that learns meta-stable state transition representation for ADHD identification.

Short Memory-Based Human Strategy Modeling in Social Dilemmas,Mathematics,"Human decision-making processes are complex. It is thus challenging to mine human strategies from real games in social networks. To model human strategies in social dilemmas, we conducted a series of human subject experiments in which the temporal two-player non-cooperative games among 1092 players were intensively investigated. Our goal is to model the individuals’ moves in the next round based on the information observed in each round. Therefore, the developed model is a strategy model based on short-term memory. Due to the diversity of user strategies, we first cluster players’ behaviors to aggregate them with similar strategies for the following modeling. Through behavior clustering, our observations show that the performance of the tested binary strategy models can be highly promoted in the largest behavior groups. Our results also suggest that no matter whether in the classical mode or the dissipative mode, the influence of individual accumulated payoffs on individual behavior is more significant than the gaming result of the last round. This result challenges a previous consensus that individual moves largely depend on the gaming result of the last round. Therefore, our model provides a novel perspective for understanding the evolution of human altruistic behavior.",22277390,2.617
A New Method for Extracting the Hierarchical Organization of Networks,International Journal of Information Technology & Decision Making,"Extracting the hierarchical organization of networks is currently a pressing task for understanding complex networked systems. The hierarchy of a network is essentially defined by the heterogeneity of link densities of communities at different scales. Here, we define a top-level partition (TLP) as a bipartition of the network (or a sub-network) such that no top-level community (TLC) runs across the two parts. It has been found that a TLP generally has a higher modularity than a non-top-level (TLP) partition when their TLCs have similar sizes and when the link densities of neighboring levels are well separated from each other. A spectral TLP procedure is proposed here to search for TLPs of a network (or sub-network). To extract the hierarchical organization of large complex networks, an algorithm called TLPA has been developed based on the TLP.

DPNuc: Identifying Nucleosome Positions Based on the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,"Nucleosomes and the free linker DNA between them assemble the chromatin. Nucleosome positioning plays an important role in gene transcription regulation, DNA replication and repair, alternative splicing, and so on. With the rapid development of ChIP-seq, it is possible to computationally detect the positions of nucleosomes on chromosomes. However, existing methods cannot provide accurate and detailed information about the detected nucleosomes, especially for the nucleosomes with complex configurations where overlaps and noise exist. Meanwhile, they usually require some prior knowledge of nucleosomes as input, such as the size or the number of the unknown nucleosomes, which may significantly influence the detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach DPNuc for identifying nucleosome positions based on the Dirichlet process mixture model. In our method, Markov chain Monte …","15455963, 15579964",3.714
Revisiting topological properties of protein-protein interaction networks from the perspective of dataset evolution,2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),"Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are crucial for organisms.

Constrained Spectral Clustering Using Absorbing Markov Chains,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications,"Constrained spectral clustering (CSC) has recently shown great promise in improving clustering accuracy or catering for some specific grouping bias by encoding pairwise constraints into spectral clustering.

Those methods have made significant progresses, but little of them takes the extensional sense of pairwise constraints into account, e.g., respective neighbors of two musk-link points lie in a same cluster with certain high probabilities, and respective neighbors of two cannot-link points lie in different clusters with certain high probabilities, etc. In this paper, we use absorbing Markov chains to formulate the extensional sense of instance-level …",-,153.0

Using this indexing model, on one hand, retrieval systems need to keep only the indexing data, instead of the indexing data and the original text data as the traditional retrieval systems always do. On the other hand, occurrences of index term are identified by labels of the so-called s-strings where the index term appears, rather than by its positions as in traditional indexing models. Consequently, system space cost as a whole can be reduced drastically while retrieval efficiency is maintained satisfactory.

"Inflection, canards and excitability threshold in neuronal models",Journal of mathematical biology,"A technique is presented, based on the differential geometry of planar curves, to evaluate the excitability threshold of neuronal models. The aim is to determine regions of the phase plane where solutions to the model equations have zero local curvature, thereby defining a zero-curvature (inflection) set that discerns between sub-threshold and spiking electrical activity. This transition can arise through a Hopf bifurcation, via the so-called canard explosion that happens in an exponentially small parameter variation, and this is typical for a large class of planar neuronal models (FitzHugh–Nagumo, reduced Hodgkin–Huxley), namely, type II neurons (resonators). This transition can also correspond to the crossing of the stable manifold of a saddle equilibrium, in the case of type I neurons (integrators). We compute inflection sets and study how well they approximate the excitability threshold of these neuron …","03036812, 14321416",2.145
Transverse bifurcations of homoclinic cycles,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Homoclinic cycles exist robustly in dynamical systems with symmetry, and may undergo various bifurcations, not all of which have an analog in the absence of symmetry. We analyze such a bifurcation, the transverse bifurcation, and uncover a variety of phenomena that can be distinguished representation-theoretically. For example, exponentially flat branches of periodic solutions (a typical feature of bifurcation from homoclinic cycles) occur for some but not all representations of the symmetry group. Our study of transverse bifurcations is motivated by the problem of intermittent dynamos in rotating convection.",01672789,3.117
Mixed-mode oscillations in a multiple time scale phantom bursting system,SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems,"In this work we study mixed-mode oscillations in a model of secretion of GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone). The model is a phantom burster consisting of two feedforward coupled FitzHugh--Nagumo systems, with three time scales. The forcing system (regulator) evolves on the slowest scale and acts by moving the slow nullcline of the forced system (secretor). There are three modes of dynamics: pulsatility (transient relaxation oscillation), surge (quasi-steady state), and small oscillations related to the passage of the slow nullcline through a fold point of the fast nullcline. We derive a variety of reductions, taking advantage of the mentioned features of the system. We obtain two results: one on the local dynamics near the fold in the parameter regime corresponding to the presence of small oscillations, and the other on the global dynamics, more specifically on the existence of an attracting limit cycle. Our local …",15360040,1.647
Spike-adding in parabolic bursters: the role of folded-saddle canards,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"The present work develops a new approach to studying parabolic bursting, and also proposes a novel four-dimensional canonical and polynomial-based parabolic burster. In addition to this new polynomial system, we also consider the conductance-based model of the Aplysia R15 neuron known as the Plant model, and a reduction of this prototypical biophysical parabolic burster to three variables, including one phase variable, namely the Baer–Rinzel–Carillo (BRC) phase model. Revisiting these models from the perspective of slow–fast dynamics reveals that the number of spikes per burst may vary upon parameter changes, however the spike-adding process occurs in an explosive fashion that involves special solutions called canards. This spike-adding canard explosion phenomenon is analysed by using tools from geometric singular perturbation theory in tandem with numerical bifurcation techniques. We find …",01672789,3.117
Geometric desingularization of a cusp singularity in slow–fast systems with applications to Zeeman’s examples,Journal of dynamics and differential equations,"The cusp singularity—a point at which two curves of fold points meet—is a prototypical example in Takens’ classification of singularities in constrained equations, which also includes folds, folded saddles, folded nodes, among others. In this article, we study cusp singularities in singularly perturbed systems for sufficiently small values of the perturbation parameter, in the regime in which these systems exhibit fast and slow dynamics. Our main result is an analysis of the cusp point using the method of geometric desingularization, also known as the blow-up method, from the field of geometric singular perturbation theory. Our analysis of the cusp singularity was inspired by the nerve impulse example of Zeeman, and we also apply our main theorem to it.

The period adding and incrementing bifurcations: from rotation theory to applications,SIAM Review,"This survey article is concerned with the study of bifurcations of discontinuous piecewise-smooth maps, with a special focus on the one-dimensional case. We review the literature on circle maps and quasi-contractions and provide paths through this literature to prove sufficient conditions for the occurrence of two types of bifurcation scenarios involving rich dynamics. The first scenario consists of the appearance of periodic orbits whose symbolic sequences and “rotation” numbers follow a Farey tree structure; the periods of the periodic orbits are given by consecutive addition. This is called the period adding bifurcation, and the proof of its existence relies on results for maps on the circle. In the second scenario, symbolic sequences are obtained by consecutive attachment of a given symbolic block, and the periods of periodic orbits are incremented by a constant term. This is called the period incrementing bifurcation …","00361445, 10957200",7.976
Gamma oscillations as a mechanism for selective information transmission,Biological cybernetics,"In the past decades, many studies have focussed on the relation between the input and output of neurons with the aim to understand information processing by neurons. A particular aspect of neuronal information, which has not received much attention so far, concerns the problem of information transfer when a neuron or a population of neurons receives input from two or more (populations of) neurons, in particular when these (populations of) neurons carry different types of information. The aim of the present study is to investigate the responses of neurons to multiple inputs modulated in the gamma frequency range. By a combination of theoretical approaches and computer simulations, we test the hypothesis that enhanced modulation of synchronized excitatory neuronal activity in the gamma frequency range provides an advantage over a less synchronized input for various types of neurons.

The response of a classical Hodgkin–Huxley neuron to an inhibitory input pulse,Journal of computational neuroscience,"A population of uncoupled neurons can often be brought close to synchrony by a single strong inhibitory input pulse affecting all neurons equally. This mechanism is thought to underlie some brain rhythms, in particular gamma frequency (30–80 Hz) oscillations in the hippocampus and neocortex. Here we show that synchronization by an inhibitory input pulse often fails for populations of classical Hodgkin–Huxley neurons. Our reasoning suggests that in general, synchronization by inhibitory input pulses can fail when the transition of the target neurons from rest to spiking involves a Hopf bifurcation, especially when inhibition is shunting, not hyperpolarizing. Surprisingly, synchronization is more likely to fail when the inhibitory pulse is stronger or longer-lasting. These findings have potential implications for the question which neurons participate in brain rhythms, in particular in gamma oscillations.","09295313, 15736873",1.086
From Parkinsonian thalamic activity to restoring thalamic relay using deep brain stimulation: new insights from computational modeling,Journal of neural engineering,"We present a computational model of a thalamocortical relay neuron for exploring basal ganglia thalamocortical loop behavior in relation to Parkinson's disease and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Previous microelectrode, single-unit recording studies demonstrated that oscillatory interaction within and between basal ganglia nuclei is very often accompanied by synchronization at Parkinsonian rest tremor frequencies (3–10 Hz). These oscillations have a profound influence on thalamic projections and impair the thalamic relaying of cortical input by generating rebound action potentials. Our model describes convergent inhibitory input received from basal ganglia by the thalamocortical cells based on characteristics of normal activity, and/or low-frequency oscillations (activity associated with Parkinson's disease). In addition to simulated input, we also used microelectrode recordings as inputs for the model. In the …",17412560,3.992
Canard solutions in planar piecewise linear systems with three zones,Dynamical Systems,"In this work, we analyze the existence and stability of canard solutions in a class of planar piecewise linear systems with three zones, using a singular perturbation theory approach. To this aim, we follow the analysis of the classical canard phenomenon in smooth planar slow–fast systems and adapt it to the piecewise-linear framework. We first prove the existence of an intersection between repelling and attracting slow manifolds, which defines a maximal canard, in a non-generic system of the class having a continuum of periodic orbits. Then, we perturb this situation and we prove the persistence of the maximal canard solution, as well as the existence of a family of canard limit cycles in this class of systems. Similarities and differences between the piecewise linear case and the smooth one are highlighted.",14689367,0.438
Complex oscillations in the delayed FitzHugh–Nagumo equation,Journal of Nonlinear Science,"Motivated by the dynamics of neuronal responses, we analyze the dynamics of the FitzHugh–Nagumo slow–fast system with delayed self-coupling. This system provides a canonical example of a canard explosion for sufficiently small delays. Beyond this regime, delays significantly enrich the dynamics, leading to mixed-mode oscillations, bursting and chaos. These behaviors emerge from a delay-induced subcritical Bogdanov–Takens instability arising at the fold points of the S-shaped critical manifold. Underlying the transition from canard-induced to delay-induced dynamics is an abrupt switch in the nature of the Hopf bifurcation.","09388974, 14321467",2.5

The neuronal model includes standard spiking currents (sodium and potassium) that play a critical role in the analysis of the interspike interval as well as persistent sodium and slow potassium (M) currents. We reduce the dimensionality of the neuronal model from six to three dimensions in order to investigate a regime in which MMOs are generated and to motivate the three time-scale model system upon which we focus our study.

Modeling cortical spreading depression induced by the hyperactivity of interneurons,Journal of Computational Neuroscience,"Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of transient intense neuronal firing leading to a long lasting depolarizing block of neuronal activity. It is a proposed pathological mechanism of migraine with aura. Some forms of migraine are associated with a genetic mutation of the Nav1.1 channel, resulting in its gain of function and implying hyperexcitability of interneurons. This leads to the counterintuitive hypothesis that intense firing of interneurons can cause CSD ignition. To test this hypothesis in silico, we developed a computational model of an E-I pair (a pyramidal cell and an interneuron), in which the coupling between the cells in not just synaptic, but takes into account also the effects of the accumulation of extracellular potassium caused by the activity of the neurons and of the synapses. In the context of this model, we show that the intense firing of the interneuron can lead to CSD. We have investigated the …","09295313, 15736873",1.086

We show that the wakefields’ growth and amplitude increase with increasing seed amplitude as well as with the proton bunch charge in the plasma. We study transverse wakefields using the maximum radius of the proton bunch distribution measured on a screen downstream from the plasma. We study longitudinal wakefields by externally injecting electrons and measuring their final energy. Measurements agree with trends predicted by theory and numerical simulations and validate our understanding of the development of self-modulation.

Adaptation and shunting inhibition leads to pyramidal/interneuron gamma with sparse firing of pyramidal cells,Journal of computational neuroscience,"Gamma oscillations are a prominent phenomenon related to a number of brain functions. Data show that individual pyramidal neurons can fire at rate below gamma with the population showing clear gamma oscillations and synchrony. In one kind of idealized model of such weak gamma, pyramidal neurons fire in clusters. Here we provide a theory for clustered gamma PING rhythms with strong inhibition and weaker excitation. Our simulations of biophysical models show that the adaptation of pyramidal neurons coupled with their low firing rate leads to cluster formation. A partially analytic study of a canonical model shows that the phase response curves with a near zero flat region, caused by the presence of the slow adaptive current, are the key to the formation of clusters. Furthermore we examine shunting inhibition and show that clusters become robust and generic","09295313, 15736873",1.086

One of the most striking features of neuroendocrine networks is their ability to exhibit very slow rhythms of neurosecretion, on the order of one or several hours. A prototypical instance is that of the pulsatile secretion pattern of GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone), the master hormone controlling the reproductive function, whose origin remains a puzzle issue since its discovery in the seventies. In this paper, we investigate the question of GnRH neuron synchronization on a mesoscopic scale, and study how synchronized events in calcium dynamics can arise from the average electric activity of individual neurons.

The system possesses an attractive limit cycle along which oscillations of three different amplitudes and frequencies can appear, namely, small oscillations, pulses (medium amplitude) and one surge (largest amplitude). In addition to proving the existence and attractiveness of the limit cycle, we focus our attention on the canard phenomena underlying the changes in the number of small oscillations and pulses. We analyze locally the existence of secondary canards leading to the addition or subtraction of one small oscillation and describe how this change is globally compensated for or not with the addition or subtraction of one pulse.",01672789,3.117
A multiple time scale coupling of piecewise linear oscillators. application to a neuroendocrine system,SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems,"We analyze a four-dimensional slow-fast piecewise linear system consisting of two coupled McKean caricatures of the FitzHugh--Nagumo system. Each oscillator is a continuous slow-fast piecewise linear system with three zones of linearity. The coupling is one-way, that is, one subsystem evolves independently and is forcing the other subsystem. In contrast to the original FitzHugh--Nagumo system, we consider a negative slope of the linear nullcline in both the forcing and the forced system. In the forcing system, this lets us, by just changing one parameter, pass from a system having one equilibrium and a relaxation cycle to a system with three equilibria keeping the relaxation cycle. Thus, we can easily control the changes in the oscillation frequency of the forced system. The case with three equilibria and a linear slow nullcline is a new configuration of the McKean caricature, where the existence of the relaxation cycle …",15360040,1.647

Time-coded neurotransmitter release at excitatory and inhibitory synapses,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"Communication between neurons at chemical synapses is regulated by hundreds of different proteins that control the release of neurotransmitter that is packaged in vesicles, transported to an active zone, and released when an input spike occurs. Neurotransmitter can also be released asynchronously, that is, after a delay following the spike, or spontaneously in the absence of a stimulus. The mechanisms underlying asynchronous and spontaneous neurotransmitter release remain elusive. Here, we describe a model of the exocytotic cycle of vesicles at excitatory and inhibitory synapses that accounts for all modes of vesicle release as well as short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP). For asynchronous release, the model predicts a delayed inertial protein unbinding associated with the SNARE complex assembly immediately after vesicle priming.

Bifurcation of traveling waves in extrinsic semiconductors,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"We analyze the bifurcation of traveling waves in a standard model of electrical conduction in extrinsic semiconductors. In scaled variables the corresponding traveling wave problem is a singularly perturbed nonlinear three-dimensional o.d.e. system. The relevant bifurcation parameters are the wave speed s and the total current j. By means of geometric singular perturbation theory it suffices to analyze a two-dimensional reduced problem. Depending on the relative size of s and a dimensionless small parameter β different types of traveling waves exist. For 0≤s≪β the only waves are fronts corresponding to heteroclinic orbits. For β≪s similar fronts — but with left and right states reversed — exist. The transition between these regimes occurs for s=O(β) in a complicated global bifurcation involving a Hopf bifurcation, bifurcation of multiple periodic orbits, and heteroclinic and homoclinic bifurcations.

Using analytical and semianalytical methods, we were able to derive characteristic spiking times for the system in two distinct regimes (depending on parameter values): one regime where the gamma neuron is intrinsically oscillating in the absence of theta input, and a second one in which gamma spiking is directly gated by theta input, i.e., windows of gamma activity alternate with silence periods depending on the underlying theta phase. In the former case, we transform the equations such that the system becomes analogous to the Mathieu differential equation. By solving this equation, we can compute numerically the time to the first gamma spike, and then use singular perturbation theory to find successive spike times. On the …",21908567,1.8
From canards of folded singularities to torus canards in a forced van der Pol equation,Journal of Nonlinear Science,"In this article, we study canard solutions of the forced van der Pol equation in the relaxation limit for low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency periodic forcing. A central numerical observation made herein is that there are two branches of canards in parameter space which extend across all positive forcing frequencies. In the low-frequency forcing regime, we demonstrate the existence of primary maximal canards induced by folded saddle nodes of type I and establish explicit formulas for the parameter values at which the primary maximal canards and their folds exist. Then, we turn to the intermediate- and high-frequency forcing regimes and show that the forced van der Pol possesses torus canards instead.

Synchronization of weakly coupled canard oscillators,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Synchronization has been studied extensively in the context of weakly coupled oscillators using the so-called phase response curve (PRC) which measures how a change of the phase of an oscillator is affected by a small perturbation. This approach was based upon the work of Malkin, and it has been extended to relaxation oscillators. Namely, synchronization conditions were established under the weak coupling assumption, leading to a criterion for the existence of synchronous solutions of weakly coupled relaxation oscillators. Previous analysis relies on the fact that the slow nullcline does not intersect the fast nullcline near one of its fold points, where canard solutions can arise. In the present study we use numerical continuation techniques to solve the adjoint equations and we show that synchronization properties of canard cycles are different than those of classical relaxation cycles.

For overlapping postsynaptic potentials, the linear stability analysis of the splay state should also take in account, besides the actual values of the membrane potentials, the firing times associated with the previous pulse emissions.

Stability computations for nilpotent Hopf bifurcations in coupled cell systems,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Vanderbauwhede and van Gils, Krupa, and Langford studied unfoldings of bifurcations with purely imaginary eigenvalues and a nonsemisimple linearization, which generically occurs in codimension three. In networks of identical coupled ODE these nilpotent Hopf bifurcations can occur in codimension one. Elmhirst and Golubitsky showed that these bifurcations can lead to surprising branching patterns of periodic solutions, where the type of bifurcation depends in part on the existence of an invariant subspace corresponding to partial synchrony. We study the stability of some of these bifurcating solutions. In the absence of partial synchrony the problem is similar to the generic codimension three problem. In this case we show that the bifurcating branches are generically unstable.

Border collision bifurcations of stroboscopic maps in periodically driven spiking models,SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems,"In this work we consider a general nonautonomous hybrid system based on the integrate-and-fire model, widely used as simplified version of neuronal models and other types of excitable systems. Our assumptions are that the system is monotonic, possesses an attracting subthreshold equilibrium point, and is forced by means of a periodic pulsatile (square wave) function. In contrast to classical methods, in our approach we use the stroboscopic map (time- return map) instead of the so-called firing map. It becomes a discontinuous map potentially defined in an infinite number of partitions. By applying theory for piecewise-smooth systems, we avoid relying on particular computations, and we develop a novel approach that can be easily extended to systems with other topologies (expansive dynamics) and higher dimensions. More precisely, we rigorously study the bifurcation structure in the two-dimensional parameter …",15360040,1.647
Symmetry breaking and symmetry locking in equivariant circle maps,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Circle maps which commute with actions of a finite cyclic or dihedral group, G, are considered as models for symmetric dynamical systems which undergo “symmetry breaking” and “symmetry increasing” bifurcations. The possible symmetry breaking bifurcations of periodic orbits are classified. Two notions of “symmetry locking” are defined. Full symmetry locking occurs when the symmetry groups of (the closures of) all trajectories of a map are contained in some proper subgroup of G. Partial symmetry locking occurs when the symmetry groups of all trajectories in some invariant open subset of the circle are contained in a proper subgroup of G. Full symmetry locking is essentially equivalent to frequency locking. Partial symmetry locking occurs in “unimodal windows” in parameter space and in certain regions of the Arnold tongues of the maps.

The present manuscript revisits these systems, specifically by analysing the dynamics near a folded singularity from the viewpoint of inflection sets of the flow. Originally, the inflection set method was developed for planar systems [Brøns and Bar-Eli in Proc R Soc A 445(1924):305–322, 1994; Okuda in Prog Theor Phys 68(6):1827–1840, 1982; Peng et al. in Philos Trans R Soc A 337(1646):275–289, 1991] and then extended to N-dimensional systems [Ginoux et al. in Int J Bifurc Chaos 18(11):3409–3430, 2008], although not tailored to specific dynamics (e.g. folded singularities).

Latching dynamics in neural networks with synaptic depression,Plos one,"Prediction is the ability of the brain to quickly activate a target concept in response to a related stimulus (prime). Experiments point to the existence of an overlap between the populations of the neurons coding for different stimuli, and other experiments show that prime-target relations arise in the process of long term memory formation. The classical modelling paradigm is that long term memories correspond to stable steady states of a Hopfield network with Hebbian connectivity. Experiments show that short term synaptic depression plays an important role in the processing of memories. This leads naturally to a computational model of priming, called latching dynamics; a stable state (prime) can become unstable and the system may converge to another transiently stable steady state (target). Hopfield network models of latching dynamics have been studied by means of numerical simulation, however the conditions for the existence of this dynamics have not been elucidated. In this work we use a combination of analytic and numerical approaches to confirm that latching dynamics can exist in the context of a symmetric Hebbian learning rule, however lacks robustness and imposes a number of biologically unrealistic restrictions on the model. In particular our work shows that the symmetry of the Hebbian rule is not an obstruction to the existence of latching dynamics, however fine tuning of the parameters of the model is needed.",19326203,3.107
Noise-induced canard and mixed-mode oscillations in large-scale stochastic networks,SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics,"Slow-fast dynamical systems, such as those describing the excitable dynamics of nerve cells, can present a variety of very delicate phenomena, such as canard explosions or mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), in which dramatic transitions occur upon very small variation of the parameters. In biological situations, these excitable systems are coupled and subject to intense noise, which may have the effect of destroying these phenomena. While this is true for single cells or small networks, we show that large-scale networks do display reliable canard explosions and MMOs in the presence of noise, and these transitions can even occur upon variation of the noise standard deviation. We show that this phenomenon can be related to averaging effects occurring in large populations by investigating a network of interconnected Wilson--Cowan rate neurons which converges to a stochastic process whose mean satisfies a …","00361399, 1095712X",2.029

Neuronal mechanisms for sequential activation of memory items: Dynamics and reliability,Plos one,"In this article we present a biologically inspired model of activation of memory items in a sequence. Our model produces two types of sequences, corresponding to two different types of cerebral functions: activation of regular or irregular sequences. The switch between the two types of activation occurs through the modulation of biological parameters, without altering the connectivity matrix. Some of the parameters included in our model are neuronal gain, strength of inhibition, synaptic depression and noise. We investigate how these parameters enable the existence of sequences and influence the type of sequences observed. In particular we show that synaptic depression and noise drive the transitions from one memory item to the next and neuronal gain controls the switching between regular and irregular (random) activation.",19326203,3.107
Slow-fast transitions to seizure states in the Wendling-Chauvel neural mass model,Opera Medica et Physiologica,"We revisit the Wendling-Chauvel neural mass model by reducing it to eight ODEs and adding a dierential equation that accounts for a dynamic evolution of the slow inhibitory synaptic gain. This allows to generate dynamic transitions in the resulting nine-dimensional model. The output of the extended model can be related to EEG patterns observed during epileptic seizure, in particular isolated pre-ictal spikes and low-voltage fast oscillations at seizure onset. We analyse the extended model using basic tools from slow-fast dynamical systems theory and relate the main transitions towards seizure states to torus canards, a type of solutions that has been shown to explain the spiking to bursting transition in many neural models. We nd that the original ten-dimensional Wendling-Chauvel model can be reduced to eight dimensions, two variables being scaled versions of two other variables of the model. We then obtain a model with four PSP blocks, which is consistent with the block-diagrams typically presented to describe this model. Instead of varying the slow inhibitory synaptic gain parameter B quasi-statically, or just performing numerical bifurcation analysis in B as the structure of the fast subsystem of an hypothetical extended system, we construct a true slow dynamics for B, depending sensitively on the main PSP output of the model, Y0. Near fold bifurcation of limit cycles of the original model, the solution to the extended model performs fast low-amplitude oscillations close to both attracting and repelling branches of limit cycles, which is the signature of a torus canard phenomenon.","25002287, 25002295",0.372
Extending geometric singular perturbation theory to nonhyperbolic points,preprint,"The geometric approach to singular perturbation problems is based on powerful methods from dynamical systems theory. These techniques have been very successful in the case of normally hyperbolic critical manifolds. However, at points where normal hyperbolicity fails, eg fold points or points of self-intersection of the critical manifold, the well developed geometric theory does not apply. We present a method based on blow-up techniques which leads to a rigorous geometric analysis of these problems.

Analysis of proton bunch parameters in the AWAKE experiment,Journal of Instrumentation,A precise characterization of the incoming proton bunch parameters is required to accurately simulate the self-modulation process in the Advanced Wakefield Experiment (AWAKE).

The transverse structure of the bunch is observed at multiple positions along the beamline using scintillating or optical transition radiation screens. The parameters of a model that describes the bunch transverse dimensions and divergence are fitted to represent the observed data using Bayesian inference.

Modeling dopaminergic modulation of clustered gamma rhythms,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"Gamma rhythm (20–100 Hz) plays a key role in numerous cognitive tasks: working memory, sensory processing and in routing of information across neural circuits. In comparison with lower frequency oscillations in the brain, gamma-rhythm associated firing of the individual neurons is sparse and the activity is locally distributed in the cortex. Such “weak” gamma rhythm results from synchronous firing of pyramidal neurons in an interplay with the local inhibitory interneurons in a ""pyramidal-interneuron gamma"" or PING. Experimental evidence shows that individual pyramidal neurons during such oscillations tend to fire at rates below gamma, with the population showing clear gamma oscillations and synchrony. One possible way to describe such features is that this gamma oscillation is generated within local synchronous neuronal clusters. The number of such synchronous clusters defines the overall coherence of …",10075704,3.864

These clusters can be modulated by some brain neuromodulators: dopamine, acetylcholine and adrenaline, etc. Within this paper we consider the influence of dopamine modulation on the cluster formation process of in the PING network model of the weak gamma rhythm.","22237038, 22264116",1.015

In an earlier study we have obtained rigorous results on the bifurcation structure in such systems, with emphasis on the relation between the firing-rate and the rotation number of the existing periodic orbits. In this work we study how these bifurcation structures behave upon variation of the frequency of the input. This allows us to show that the dependence of the firing-rate on frequency of the drive follows a devil's staircase with non-monotonic steps and that there is an optimal response in the whole frequency domain. We also characterize certain bounded frequency windows in which the firing-rate exhibits a bell-shaped envelope with a global maximum.","09517715, 13616544",1.685

Second, the amplitude of the high-frequency oscillations is large, suggesting an important role for these oscillations in applications. Third, the 1:1 synchronized solution may lose stability, and, contrary to other cases, this occurs at smaller, but not at higher frequency differences between intrinsic and forcing oscillations.

The basic question addressed in this work is whether, given a sequence of steady patterns, it is possible by applying classical learning rules to build a matrix of connections between neurons in the network, such that a heteroclinic dynamics links these patterns. It has been shown previously that the answer is positive in the case where the sequence is a so-called simple consecutive cycle.

Delayed and asynchronous neurotransmitter release,Opera Medica et Physiologica,"Electrical activity of dendritic spines in cellular microdomains in general remains unclear unresolved. The electrical current is carried by moving ions and induces a local change in the voltage, which can modulate the opening of channels and contribute to the initiation of an action potential.

We further study their stability conditions. Relying only on theoretical results of the model, we construct bifurcation diagrams involving refuge and harvest limit parameters.

To represent the host-parasite dynamics, two semi-discrete models are proposed. During each cropping season, free nematodes enter the plant roots, on which they feed and reproduce. At the end of the cropping season, fruits are harvested. In the first model, the parent plant is cut down to be replaced by one of its suckers and pesticides are applied.

The aim is to find the best way, in terms of profit, to allocate the durations of fallow periods between the cropping seasons, over a fixed time horizon spanning several seasons. The existence of an optimal allocation is proven and an adaptive random search algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem.

Optimal intervention strategies of staged progression HIV infections through an age-structured model with probabilities of ART drop out,Mathematical Modelling of Natural Phenomena,"In this paper, we construct a model to describe the transmission of HIV in a homogeneous host population.

Optimal Strategy in a Two Resources Two Consumers Grazing Model,Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems,"In this paper, we consider a mathematical model of two herbivore groups and two available resources, described by a control system. The controls model how the herbivores feed on the two types of resources. The choice of these controls is based on the standard assumption of optimal feeding theory that requires each predator to maximize the net rate of energy intake during feeding. Qualitative analysis of the model highlights four resource thresholds, called resource switching densities. At these thresholds, herbivores can have pure dynamics, meaning that they consume only one type of resource, or adaptive dynamics, meaning that they consume both types of resources.

Mathematical modelling of the dynamics of human schistosomiasis with time-discrete delays,Boletín de la Sociedad Matemática Mexicana,"In this paper, we study a schistosomiasis model incorporating the miracidia and cercariae dynamics, discrete-time delays as well as control measures like water treatment. Modelling the dynamics of schistosomiasis infectious disease is quite challenging because of the different larval forms assumed by the parasite and the requirement of two hosts during the life cycle. Our model is generic in the sense that it considers both situations where particle depletion by hosts or snails could have or not a negligible impact on particle dynamics. Precisely, we introduce two parameters u and v such that when , then particle depletion by hosts or snails is not considered; when , then particle depletion by hosts and snails is considered. The model is analyzed to gain insights into the qualitative features of the disease-free equilibrium which allows the determination of the basic reproductive number .

Multiscale modelling of hepatitis B virus at cell level of organization,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,"Multiscale modelling is a promising quantitative approach for studying infectious disease dynamics. This approach garners attention from both individuals who model diseases and those who plan for public health because it has great potential to contribute in expanding the understanding necessary for managing, reducing, and potentially exterminating infectious diseases. In this article, we developed a nested multiscale model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) that integrates the within-cell scale and the between-cell scale at cell level of organization of this disease system. The between-cell scale is linked to the within-cell scale by a once off inflow of initial viral infective inoculum dose from the between-cell scale to the within-cell scale through the process of infection; the within-cell scale is linked to the between-cell scale through the outflow of the virus from the within-cell scale to the between-cell scale through the process of viral shedding or excretion. The resulting multiple scales model is bidirectionally coupled in such a way that the within-cell scale and between-cell scale sub-models mutually affect each other, creating a reciprocal relationship. The computed reproductive number from the multiscale model confirms that the within-host scale and the between-host scale influence each other in a reciprocal manner. Numerical simulations are presented that also confirm the theoretical results and support the initial assumption that the within-cell scale and the between-cell scale influence each other in a reciprocal manner. This multiple scales modeling approach serves as a valuable tool for assessing the impact and success of health strategies aimed at …","15471063, 15510018",2.404
Bioeconomic Viability and Resilience of Savanna,Environmental Modeling & Assessment,"Our paper investigates the bioeconomic sustainability and resilience of savanna social-ecological systems (SES). A stylized dynamics of an exploited grass-tree systems is thus considered accounting both for the competition between trees and grass along with logging and grass harvesting activities. Regarding sustainability, we rely on bioeconomic viability goals including consumption security for grass, profitability of logging, and coexistence of tree-grass states. A first analytical result relates to the elicitation of sufficient sustainability conditions through the non-emptiness of the so-called viability kernel. Such sufficient conditions rely on coupled MSY (maximum sustainable yield)-MEY (maximum economic yield) reference states-controls.

Optimal intervention strategies of a SI-HIV models with differential infectivity and time delays.,Discrete & Continuous Dynamical Systems-Series B,"HIV infection is divided into stages of infection which are determined by the CD4 cells count progression. Through each stage, the time delay for the progression is important because the duration of HIV infection varies according to the infectious. Retarded optimal control theory is applied to a system of delays ordinary differential equations modeling the evolution of HIV with differential infectivity. Seeking to reduce the population of the infective individuals with low CD4 cells, we use the ARV drug to control the fraction of infective individuals that is identified and will be put under treatment. We use optimal control theory to study our proposed system. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effect of the Antiretroviral treatment (ART) taking into account the delays.
1. Introduction. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)[26, 6]. HIV weakens your immune system by destroying cells that are essential for fighting diseases and infections. Without treatment, the immune system becomes too weak and the CD4 becomes lower and lower in the body. The use of drugs to suppress replication of the HIV has transformed the face of AIDS in the developed world [27]. Pronounced reductions in illness and death have been achieved and health care utilization has diminished [27]. Many models have been done for the spread of HIV [2, 12, 18, 21]. HIV models with control or delays have been proposed [23, 9, 14, 25, 19, 20, 5] but few deal with control of delayed staged progression models as in the context of this work.

Optimal harvesting and stability analysis in a Leslie-Gower delayed predator-prey model,Commun. Math. Biol. Neurosci.,"A delayed Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with continuous threshold prey harvesting is studied. Existence and local stability of the positive equilibrium of the system with or without delay are completely determined in the parameter plane. Considering delay as parameter, we investigate the effect of delay on stability of the coexisting equilibrium. It is observed that there are stability switches and a Hopf bifurcation occurs when the delay crosses some critical values. Employing the normal form theory, the direction and stability of the Hopf bifurcations are explicitly determined by the parameters of the system. Optimal harvesting is also investigated and some numerical simulations are given to support and extend our theoretical results.",20522541,0.644
An agricultural control of Radopholus similis in banana plantations,HAL,"Radopholus similis is the major parasitic nematode of banana and plantain plants worldwide. R. Similis feeds on the root tissues and causes damages going from simple root lesions, reducing the crop yield, to the fall of seedlings. Hence, R. similis is one of the most regulated plant pests. Its control mainly relies on toxic nematicides, but with limited efficiency. Our global aim is to design more efficient and sustainable control strategies, including alternative methods to nematicides. Our approach is based on a hybrid model describing the plant-nematode interactions over several cropping seasons. During the inter-season, in the absence of host, the pest population undergoes a rapid decay. A longer inter-season duration reduces the pest population the following season, which is correlated with the seasonal crop yield. However, longer inter-season durations also decrease the number of cropping seasons during a fixed time horizon, and potentially the multi-seasonal yield. An optimisation problem is therefore formulated to determine the inter-season duration that maximises the multi-seasonal yield. Two cases are considered: a fixed or a variable inter-season duration. The existence of an optimal solution is proven and its location is computed. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate our results.","01616420, 15494713",6.35
Periodicity and stability of linear Volterra difference systems,Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications,"Recently, several authors [2–4] investigated the stability properties of systems of Volterra difference equations.

In this paper we are interested in the existence of periodic solutions of linear Volterra difference equation of both types, convolution and nonconvolution. In the nonconvolution case we take a different approach from that in [2] in developing the so-called resolvent matrix. It is worth noting that resolvent matrices here play a role analogous to that played by fundamental matrices in ordinary differential and difference equations. Our approach is adapted from the theory of integrodifferential equations in contrast to the adaptation from integral equations used in [2]. This paper is divided into three sections.

Global stability of periodic orbits of non-autonomous difference equations and population biology,Journal of Differential Equations,"Elaydi and Yakubu showed that a globally asymptotically stable(GAS) periodic orbit in an autonomous difference equation must in fact be a fixed point whenever the phase space is connected.

We show that for a k-periodic difference equation, if a periodic orbit of period r is GAS, then r must be a divisor of k. In particular sub-harmonic, or long periodic, oscillations cannot occur. Moreover, if r divides k we construct a non-autonomous dynamical system having minimum period k and which has a GAS periodic orbit with minimum period r.

Lipschitz stability of nonlinear systems of differential equations,Journal of mathematical analysis and applications,"The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a new notion of stability, which will be called uniform Lipschitz stability, for systems of differential equations. For linear systems, the notions of uniform Lipschitz stability and that of uniform stability are equivalent (Theorem 2.1). However, for nonlinear systems, the two notions are quite distinct (Examples 4.1, 4.2). In fact, uniform Lipschitz stability lies somewhere between uniform stability on one side and the notions of asymptotic stability in variation of Brauer [S] and uniform stability in variation of Brauer and Strauss [7] on the other side. Furthermore, uniform Lipschitz stability neither implies asymptotic stability nor is it implied by it (Example 4.4).

Exponential trichotomy of differential systems,Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications,"In [7] Sacker and Sell introduced a notion of trichotomy for linear differential systems. A stronger notion of trichotomy has been recently introduced in [4] by Elaydi and Hajek. This paper is concerned with the latter notion of trichotomy which will be called here exponential trichotomy.
Section 1 contains the required definitions, preliminary results, and examples. In Section 2 we give a characterization of exponential trichotomy via a certain Liapunov function (Theorem 2.3). In Section 3, we show that an upper triangular system possesses an exponential trichotomy iff the system corresponding to its diagonal possesses one (Theorem 3.1). The limiting equations are used in Section 4 to give several criteria for the existence of exponential trichotomy of the given system. In Section 5, we study the roughness of exponential trichotomy. We show here that if a linear system possesses an exponential trichotomy, then under certain nonlinear perturbations, the perturbed system exhibits a qualitative behavior which is similar to that of the nonperturbed system.","0022247X, 10960813",1.396

They had previously [3] proved both statements for period 2. In [4] the authors solved the first conjecture in the affirmative for arbitrary period and in a metric state space. In addition they showed that the period of the periodic “geometric cycle”, ie the projection of the periodic orbit onto the state space, must be a divisor of the period of the underlying system.

Lipschitz stability of nonlinear systems of differential equations. II.

Semidynamical systems with nonunique global backward extensions,Funkcial. Ekvac,"The theory of semidynamical system has been developed by Bhatia and Hajek [3]. Numerous authors contributed to the theory and we mention here the work in [2],[6] and [10] which is closely related to this paper. One of the principal motiva-tions behind the study of semidynamical systems is that they describe some classes of functional differential equations, partial differential equations of evolution, terra integral equations and control systems [10].
Roughly speaking, a semidynamical system is a dynamical system which is de-fined uniquely and has a global existence in one direction of time (either positive or negative) and lacks uniqueness or existence in the other direction. We will restrict ourselves here to those systems that possess global existence in both directions of time but lack uniqueness in atmost one direction of time. Such systems will be called semidynamical systems with nonunique global backward extensions. In [10] Hajek showed that such systems describe normal control systems (see Example 3. 6).",05328721,0.625

By using perturbation theory, and the theory of the limiting equations of non-autonomous discrete dynamical systems, we obtain global stability results. Our theoretical results indicate that evolution may promote and/or suppress the stability of the coexistence equilibrium depending on the environment. This relies crucially on the speed of evolution and on how the intra-specific competition coefficient depends on the evolving trait. In general, equilibrium destabilization occurs when , when the speed of evolution is sufficiently slow. In this case, we conclude that evolution selects against complex dynamics. However, when evolution proceeds at a faster pace …","17513758, 17513766",2.04

A continuous-time mathematical model and discrete approximations for the aggregation of β-Amyloid,Journal of Biological Dynamics,"Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disorder characterized by the loss of synapses and neurons from the brain, as well as the accumulation of amyloid-based neuritic plaques. While it remains a matter of contention whether β-amyloid causes the neurodegeneration, β-amyloid aggregation is associated with the disease progression. Therefore, gaining a clearer understanding of this aggregation may help to better understand the disease. We develop a continuous-time model for β-amyloid aggregation using concepts from chemical kinetics and population dynamics. We show the model conserves mass and establish conditions for the existence and stability of equilibria. We also develop two discrete-time approximations to the model that are dynamically consistent.

Weak isometries and their embeddings in flows.,NONLINEAR ANAL. THEORY METHODS APPLIC.,"DYNAMICAL systems generated by weak isometries on a Riemannian manifold (M, g) are characterized via the Riemannian metric g and the distance function (metric) on M induced by g. These systems are shown to be embeddable in smooth flows on M which carry the same properties.
The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of weak isometry as a generalization of the notion of isometry of a Riemannian manifold. Let f: M-, M be a diffeomorphism on a Riemannian manifold (M, g) with a Riemannian metric g and let zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcbaZYXWVUTSRQP Tf be the differential of f [2, 5]. Then f is said to be an isometry of M if it preserves the Riemannian metric g. Equivalently, f is an isometry of M if] I Tf""(u) 11= IIuII, for all u E TM and n EZ, where TM is the tangent bundle of M, II II is the norm on M induced by g [2, 5] and Z is the set of integers. Kobayashi and Nomizu [5] have shown that zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcbaZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA f is an isometry (with respect to g) of M if it is an isometry with respect to the distance function (metric) d on M induced by g; that is to say, for x, y EM, d (f”(x), p (y))= d (x, y) for all II E Z. This result is generalized to weak isometries (theorem 1.3). Furthermore, it is shown that if f is a weak isometry, then the family cf” ln EZ} is equicontinuous on M (corollary 1.5). Consequently, M admits a Riemannian metric under which f becomes an isometry [l]. For linear diffeomorphisms on Euclidean spaces the notions of equicontinuity and weak isometry coincide (corollary 1.9). In Section 2, we discuss the embedding of diffeomorphisms in smooth flows. Several criteria for the embeddability of a …",0362546X,1.457
Weakly equicontinuous flows,Funkcial. Ekvac.,"The concept of equicontinuityis central in Topological Dynamics. Yet it can be defined only in flows whose phase spaces are either uniform spaces or metric spaces. In 1970, O. Hajek [7] suggested that one can characterize equicontinuity by using the first limit prolongation relation $ J $ which was introduced by T. Ura [10]. He conjectured that for a flow $(X, T) $ the property $ J (¥ Delta)¥ subset¥ Delta $, where $¥ Delta $ is the diagonal of $ X¥ times X $, may be a candidate for a topological version of equicontinuity. In section 2 we will show that the property $ J (¥ Delta)¥ subset¥ Delta $ is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for equicontinuity (Example 2.7). A flow that has the property $ J (¥ Delta)¥ subset¥ Delta $ and pos-sesses an additional property, called $ M $, is called a weakly equicontinuous flow. It is shown that the concepts of equicontinuity and weak equicontinuity are equivalent provided that all the orbit closures in the phase space $ X $ are compact (Theorem 2.9). The concept of weak equicontinuity of a flow $(X, T) $ is shown to be somewhere be-tween equicontinuity of $(X, T) $ and that of characteristic 0 of $(X¥ times X, T) $(Theorem 2. 10).
Hajek [7] also mentioned that one of themain obstacles in lifting results from Dynamical Systems theory to Topological Dynamics is time orientation. For in the former the phase group isthe additive group of reals which is endowed with a natural order relation. While in the later this orientation of time is not available and thus we have no analogue to concepts such as wandering points, dispersive points, positive (negative) prolongation relations $ D^{+}(D^{-}) $, positive (negative) limit …",05328721,0.625

Experimental analysis of interacting HT22 plasma membrane cholesterol and β-amyloid,Advances in Alzheimer's Disease,"The peptide β-Amyloid (β-A) is known to be one of the primary factors causing neurodegeneration in the Alzheimer disease. Hence, one would like to know the factors that would increase or decrease the toxicity of β-Amyloid in the brain. One of the factors that are debated in the literature is cholesterol, where it is not clear if modulating the levels of cholesterol would affect the degree of toxicity of β-Amyloid on neuron cells in the brain. In order to investigate this problem, data were collected and analyzed for three types of experiments: 1) Correspondence between cholesterol and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) measurements; 2) measurements of the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) with respect to MβCD concentration (with/without β-A); and 3) RFU measurements with respect to β-A concentration (with/without MβCD). HT22 hippocampal neurons immortalized with the simian virus SV-40 large T-antigen plasmid vector were used to conduct the experiments. Mito-ID Membrane potential cytotoxicity was used as a measure of mitochondrial potential change.

An economical model with Allee effect,Journal of Difference Equations and Applications,"We formulate a mathematical model based on Marx theory of economics. The profit rate r is considered as a function of both the exploitation rate e and the organic composition of the capital k. This model possesses a new property, commonly used in biology, called the Allee effect, in which the profit rate declines to zero if it falls below a certain threshold. It is represented by the difference equation r n+1 = f a (r n ), which is a family of unimodal maps depending on the parameter a, where a measures the relative growth of the exploitation rate when the profit rate is zero. Moreover, the model predicts a period-doubling bifurcation scenario as the parameter a increases. Finally, we allow the parameter a fluctuate periodically which leads to a periodic non-autonomous difference equations.","10236198, 15635120",1.35
Existence and stability of periodic orbits of periodic difference equations with delays,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"In this paper, we investigate the existence and stability of periodic orbits of the p-periodic difference equation with delays xn = f(n - 1, xn-k). We show that the periodic orbits of this equation depend on the periodic orbits of p autonomous equations when p divides k. When p is not a divisor of k, the periodic orbits depend on the periodic orbits of gcd(p, k) nonautonomous p/gcd(p, k)-periodic difference equations. We give formulas for calculating the number of different periodic orbits under certain conditions. In addition, when p and k are relatively prime integers, we introduce what we call the pk-Sharkovsky's ordering of the positive integers, and extend Sharkovsky's theorem to periodic difference equations with delays. Finally, we characterize global stability and show that the period of a globally asymptotically stable orbit must be divisible by p.","02181274, 17936551",2.088

On some stability notions in topological dynamics,Journal of Differential Equations,"In 1970, Hajek 141 proposed new concepts of stability using the important notions of prolongations, which were introduced by Ura 161 and were studied in [1, 2, 4, 5 1 and many other authors. In this paper we study the Hajek stability concepts which we call D-stability and J-stability, where D denotes the prolongation relation and J denotes the prolongation limit relation. We give several characterizations to these concepts in terms of Liapunov stability, characteristic 0 [11 and equicontinuity. Ura type characterizations for the D-and J-stability are also given. It says roughly that under certain conditions a set M is D-stable iff D (M)= M and it is J-stable iff J (M)= M. A natural generalizations of the Hajek stabilities in continuous or discrete flows are D L-and J’-stability. The corresponding notions in flows in general (or transformation groups) can be defined using the replete semigroups of the phase group of the flow 13). They will be denoted by D’-and J”-stability. where P is a replete semigroup. In this case similar results are also obtained.
Let (X, T. n) be a flow, where X is always assumed to be locally compact and Hausdorff and T is a topological group. Let X*= Xu {co} be the one point compactification of X.

Effects of Cholesterol in Stress-Related Neuronal Death—A Statistical Analysis Perspective,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,"The association between plasma cholesterol levels and the development of dementia continues to be an important topic of discussion in the scientific community, while the results in the literature vary significantly. We study the effect of reducing oxidized neuronal cholesterol on the lipid raft structure of plasma membrane. The levels of plasma membrane cholesterol were reduced by treating the intact cells with methyl-ß-cyclodextrin (MßCD). The relationship between the cell viability with varying levels of MßCD was then examined. The viability curves are well described by a modified form of the empirical Gompertz law of mortality. A detailed statistical analysis is performed on the fitting results, showing that increasing MßCD concentration has a minor, rather than significant, effect on the cellular viability. In particular, the dependence of viability on MßCD concentration was found to be characterized by a ~25% increase per 1 μM of MßCD concentration.","14220067, 16616596",5.002

Attraction in topological dynamics,Journal of differential equations,"The concepts of attraction and stability are central in the theories of differential equations and dynamical systems. In 1959, Ura [121 introduced the notion of prolongation sets in order to characterize some notions of stability in continuous flows. In [1, 21, Ahmad used Ura’s prologations to characterize the notion of strong attraction in continuous flows. A systematic use of prolongations in the study of various attraction and stability notions was made by Bhatia and Szego in [3]. The theory of topological dynamics has not largely profited from these developments in the last decade. This is probably due to a major obstacle, namely, the problem of time orientation, as it was pointed out by Hajek [9] in 1970. For in the theory of dynamical systems, most of the dynamical properties are defined for either positive or negative time. Where as in topological dynamics this orientation of time is not available since the phase group of a …","00220396, 10902732",2.643

On Some Open Problems in Difference Equations,Proceedings Of The Mathematics Conference,"In the last ten years there have been a surge in research activities in difference equations and discrete dynamical systems. Many factors gave impetus to the increase of interest in difference equations among mathematicians, scientists, engineers, and economists. One important factor is the amenability of discrete models to computation by computers. Another factor is the intrinsic discrete nature of certain physical phenomena such as population dynamics, economic cycles, and neural networks, to mention only few.

Semiflows with global extensions—II. notions of negative stability,"Nonlinear Analysis: Theory, Methods & Applications","IN [2, 31, the first author established the basic theory of continuous semiflows with global backward extensions (GBE).

We conjectured in [1] that in this stability region, the coexistence (positive) equilibrium is indeed globally asymptotically stable with respect to the interior of the first quadrant. The proof of this conjecture follow a complex set of tools. It includes singularity theory of planar maps, the notion of critical curves, one-point compactification of the positive quadrant, the dynamics of the local slow manifold of the coexistence fixed point and the global unstable manifold of the exclusion fixed point.","20471025, 20471033",2.4

First, basic theoretical analysis is carried out for the case where for each agent the second-order dynamics are governed by the position and velocity terms and the asymptotic velocity is constant. A necessary and sufficient condition is given to ensure second-order consensus and it is found that both the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the corresponding network play key roles in reaching consensus. Based on this result, a second-order consensus algorithm is derived for the multi-agent system facing communication delays. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided, which shows that consensus can be achieved in a multi-agent system whose network topology contains a directed spanning tree if and only if the time delay is less than a critical value …",00051098,5.44

With the help of an explicitly constructed common Lyapunov function (CLF), it is proved that each agent can follow the active leader.

Fuzzy logic is employed only for the design; the resulting controller does not need to execute any fuzzy rule base, and is actually a conventional PID controller with analytical formulae. The main improvement is in endowing the classical controller with a certain adaptive control capability.

The control parameters used in the permutation stage and the keystream employed in the diffusion stage are generated from two chaotic maps related to the plain-image. As a result, the algorithm can effectively resist all known attacks against permutation–diffusion architectures. Theoretical analyses and computer simulations both confirm that the new algorithm possesses high security and fast encryption speed for practical image encryption.",09600779,5.969

Consensus of multi‐agent systems with nonlinear dynamics and sampled‐data information: a delayed‐input approach,International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control,"This paper is concerned with the problem of consensus in directed networks of multiple agents with intrinsic nonlinear dynamics and sampled‐data information. A new protocol is induced from a class of continuous‐time linear consensus protocols by implementing data‐sampling technique and a zero‐order hold circuit. On the basis of a delayed‐input approach, the sampled‐data multi‐agent system is converted to an equivalent nonlinear system with a time‐varying delay. Theoretical analysis on this time‐delayed system shows that consensus with asymptotic time‐varying velocities in a strongly connected network can be achieved over some suitable sampled‐data intervals. A multi‐step procedure is further presented to estimate the upper bound of the maximal allowable sampling intervals. The results are then extended to a network topology with a directed spanning tree.

Synchronization transitions on small-world neuronal networks: Effects of information transmission delay and rewiring probability,Europhysics Letters,"Synchronization transitions are investigated in small-world neuronal networks that are locally modeled by the Rulkov map with additive spatiotemporal noise. In particular, we investigate the impact of different information transmission delays and rewiring probability. We show that short delays induce zigzag fronts of excitations, whereas intermediate delays can further detriment synchrony in the network due to a dynamic clustering anti-phase synchronization transition. Detailed investigations reveal, however, that for longer delay lengths the synchrony of excitations in the network can again be enhanced due to the emergence of in-phase synchronization. In addition, we show that an appropriate small-world topology can restore synchronized behavior provided information transmission delays are either short or long. On the other hand, within the intermediate delay region, which is characterized by anti-phase …","02955075, 12864854",1.8

Distributed leader–follower flocking control for multi-agent dynamical systems with time-varying velocities,Systems & Control Letters,"Using tools from algebraic graph theory and nonsmooth analysis in combination with ideas of collective potential functions, velocity consensus and navigation feedback, a distributed leader–follower flocking algorithm for multi-agent dynamical systems with time-varying velocities is developed where each agent is governed by second-order dynamics. The distributed leader–follower algorithm considers the case in which the group has one virtual leader with time-varying velocity. For each agent i, this algorithm consists of four terms: the first term is the self nonlinear dynamics which determines the final time-varying velocity, the second term is determined by the gradient of the collective potential between agent i and all of its neighbors, the third term is the velocity consensus term, and the fourth term is the navigation feedback from the leader.

Synchronous bursts on scale-free neuronal networks with attractive and repulsive coupling,PLoS one,"This paper investigates the dependence of synchronization transitions of bursting oscillations on the information transmission delay over scale-free neuronal networks with attractive and repulsive coupling. It is shown that for both types of coupling, the delay always plays a subtle role in either promoting or impairing synchronization. In particular, depending on the inherent oscillation period of individual neurons, regions of irregular and regular propagating excitatory fronts appear intermittently as the delay increases. These delay-induced synchronization transitions are manifested as well-expressed minima in the measure for spatiotemporal synchrony. For attractive coupling, the minima appear at every integer multiple of the average oscillation period, while for the repulsive coupling, they appear at every odd multiple of the half of the average oscillation period. The obtained results are robust to the variations of the dynamics of individual neurons, the system size, and the neuronal firing type. Hence, they can be used to characterize attractively or repulsively coupled scale-free neuronal networks with delays.",19326203,3.107
A chaos-based robust wavelet-domain watermarking algorithm,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","In this paper, a chaos-based watermarking algorithm is developed in the wavelet domain for still images. The wavelet transform is commonly applied for watermarking, where the whole image is transformed in the frequency domain. In contrast to this conventional approach, we apply the wavelet transform only locally. We transform the subimage, which is extracted from the original image, in the frequency domain by using DWT and then embed the chaotic watermark into part of the subband coefficients. As usual, the watermark is detected by computing the correlation between the watermarked coefficients and the watermarking signal, where the watermarking threshold is chosen according to the Neyman–Pearson criterion based on some statistical assumptions. Watermark detection is accomplished without using the original image. Simulation results show that we can gain high fidelity and high robustness …",09600779,5.969

Rendezvous of multiple mobile agents with preserved network connectivity,Systems & Control Letters,"In coordinative control of a network of multi-agent systems, to guarantee the stability of the coordinated motion, a basic assumption typically is that the underlying topology of the network can maintain its connectivity frequently enough during the motion evolution. However, for a given set of initial conditions, this assumption is very difficult to satisfy and verify. In particular, the connectivity of the initial network generally cannot guarantee the connectivity of the network throughout the evolution. In this paper, we propose a rendezvous protocol with double-integrator dynamics, which combines the functions of motion control and connectivity preservation. This protocol can enable the group of mobile agents to converge to the same position and move with the same velocity while preserving the connectivity of the whole network during the evolution if the initial network is connected.

Finite-time consensus of multiagent systems with a switching protocol,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,"In this paper, we study the problem of finite-time consensus of multiagent systems on a fixed directed interaction graph with a new protocol. Existing finite-time consensus protocols can be divided into two types: 1) continuous and 2) discontinuous, which were studied separately in the past. In this paper, we deal with both continuous and discontinuous protocols simultaneously, and design a centralized switching consensus protocol such that the finite-time consensus can be realized in a fast speed. The switching protocol depends on the range of the initial disagreement of the agents, for which we derive an exact bound to indicate at what time a continuous or a discontinuous protocol should be selected to use. Finally, we provide two numerical examples to illustrate the superiority of the proposed protocol and design method.","2162237X, 21622388",11.831
Design and analysis of multiscroll memristive hopfield neural network with adjustable memductance and application to image encryption,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,"Memristor is an ideal electronic device used as an artificial nerve synapse due to its unique memory function. This article presents a design of a new Hopfield neural network (HNN) that can generate multiscroll attractors by utilizing a new memristor as a synapse in the HNN. Differing from the others, this memristor is constructed with hyperbolic tangent functions. Taking the memristor as a self-feedback synapse of a neuron in the HNN, the memristive HNN can yield multidouble-scroll attractors, and its parameters can be used to effectively control the number of double scrolls contained in an attractor. Interestingly, the generation of multidouble-scroll attractors is independent of the memductance function but depends only on the internal state equation. Thus, the memductance function can be adjusted to yield various complex dynamical behaviors. Moreover, amplitude control effects and quantitatively controllable …","2162237X, 21622388",11.831

Power systems as dynamic networks,2006 IEEE international symposium on circuits and systems (ISCAS),"The theory of power systems dynamics has been developed largely from detailed studies of the dynamics of simple system structures with emphasis on the effects of modeling details of the dynamics.

Design of robust fuzzy-model-based controller with sliding mode control for SISO nonlinear systems,Fuzzy Sets and Systems,"In this paper, we present the design of a new type of fuzzy controllers for controlling complex single-input–single-output systems by incorporating sliding mode control theory with fuzzy control technology.

Hopf bifurcation control using nonlinear feedback with polynomial functions,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"A general explicit formula is derived for controlling bifurcations using nonlinear state feedback.

It is shown that a simple control can be obtained to simultaneously stabilize two symmetrical equilibria of the Lorenz system, and keep the symmetry of Hopf bifurcations from the equilibria.

Discrete chaos in Banach spaces,Science in China Series A: Mathematics,"This paper is concerned with chaos in discrete dynamical systems governed by continuously Frechét differentiable maps in Banach spaces. A criterion of chaos induced by a regular nondegenerate homoclinic orbit is established. Chaos of discrete dynamical systems in then-dimensional real space is also discussed, with two criteria derived for chaos induced by nondegenerate snap-back repellers, one of which is a modified version of Marotto’s theorem. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for an expanding fixed point of a differentiable map in a general Banach space and in ann-dimensional real space, respectively.

Performance benefits of using inerter in semiactive suspensions,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,"This brief investigates the performance benefits of using inerter in semiactive suspensions. A novel structure for semiactive suspensions with inerter, which consists of a passive part and a semiactive part, is proposed.

Integration of fuzzy logic and chaos theory,Biomaterials,"The 1960s were perhaps a decade of confusion, when scientists faced d-culties in dealing with imprecise information and complex dynamics.

Chaos synchronization of the master–slave generalized Lorenz systems via linear state error feedback control,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"This paper provides a unified method for analyzing chaos synchronization of the generalized Lorenz systems. The considered synchronization scheme consists of identical master and slave generalized Lorenz systems coupled by linear state error variables. A sufficient synchronization criterion for a general linear state error feedback controller is rigorously proven by means of linearization and Lyapunov’s direct methods. When a simple linear controller is used in the scheme, some easily implemented algebraic synchronization conditions are derived based on the upper and lower bounds of the master chaotic system.

Cryptanalysis of the RCES/RSES image encryption scheme,Journal of Systems and Software,"Recently, a chaos-based image encryption scheme called RCES (also called RSES) was proposed. This paper analyses the security of RCES, and points out that it is insecure against the known/chosen-plaintext attacks: the number of required known/chosen plain-images is only one or two to succeed an attack. In addition, the security of RCES against the brute-force attack was overestimated. Both theoretical and experimental analyses are given to show the performance of the suggested known/chosen-plaintext attacks. The insecurity of RCES is due to its special design, which makes it a typical example of insecure image encryption schemes.

On various definitions of shadowing with average error in tracing,Nonlinearity,"When computing a trajectory of a dynamical system, influence of noise can lead to large perturbations which can appear, however, with small probability. Then when calculating approximate trajectories, it makes sense to consider errors small on average, since controlling them in each iteration may be impossible. Demand to relate approximate trajectories with genuine orbits leads to various notions of shadowing (on average) which we consider in the paper. As the main tools in our studies we provide a few equivalent characterizations of the average shadowing property, which also partly apply to other notions of shadowing. We prove that almost specification on the whole space induces this property on the measure center which in turn implies the average shadowing property. Finally, we study connections among sensitivity, transitivity, equicontinuity and (average) shadowing.","09517715, 13616544",1.685

The appearance and disappearance of spiral waves, as well as the transitions between spiral wave patterns with different kinds of complexity characterized by the normalized spatial autocorrelation function, enable changes in the order of the network so as to exhibit a scenario with two or more locally maximal peaks, as can be clearly seen in the signal to noise ratio curves, as the noise intensity is adjusted from small to large in a wide range. A possible physical mechanism of the multiple resonances based on the dynamics of type I excitability and initial values is provided.

BIBO stability of nonlinear fuzzy PI control systems,Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems,"In this paper, we analyze in detail the bounded-input/bounded-output (BIBO) stability of the nonlinear fuzzy proportional-integral (PI) control systems developed in Ying, Siler, and Buckley (1990).

The derived sufficient condition provides a useful criterion for the design of such fuzzy PI control systems. In addition, we prove that in a conventional PI control system, if the linear PI controller is replaced by the nonlinear fuzzy PI controller, the stability of the resulting control system remains unchanged.

Distributed average tracking for Lipschitz-type of nonlinear dynamical systems,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,"In this paper, a distributed average tracking (DAT) problem is studied for Lipschitz-type of nonlinear dynamical systems. The objective is to design DAT algorithms for locally interactive agents to track the average of multiple reference signals.

First, based on state-dependent-gain design principles, a robust DAT algorithm is developed for solving DAT problems without requiring the same initial condition. Second, by using a gain adaption scheme, an adaptive DAT algorithm is designed to remove the requirement that global information, such as the eigenvalue of the Laplacian and the Lipschitz constant, is known to all agents.

Local stability and Hopf bifurcation in small-world delayed networks,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","The notion of small-world networks, recently introduced by Watts and Strogatz, has attracted increasing interest in studying the interesting properties of complex networks. Notice that, a signal or influence travelling on a small-world network often is associated with time-delay features, which are very common in biological and physical networks. Also, the interactions within nodes in a small-world network are often nonlinear. In this paper, we consider a small-world networks model with nonlinear interactions and time delays, which was recently considered by Yang. By choosing the nonlinear interaction strength as a bifurcation parameter, we prove that Hopf bifurcation occurs. We determine the stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions and the direction of the Hopf bifurcation by applying the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem. Finally, we show a numerical example to verify the theoretical analysis.",09600779,5.969
Subgraph networks with application to structural feature space expansion,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,"Real-world networks exhibit prominent hierarchical and modular structures, with various subgraphs as building blocks. Most existing studies simply consider distinct subgraphs as motifs and use only their numbers to characterize the underlying network. Although such statistics can be used to describe a network model, or even to design some network algorithms, the role of subgraphs in such applications can be further explored so as to improve the results. In this article, the concept of subgraph network (SGN) is introduced and then applied to network models, with algorithms designed for constructing the 1st-order and 2nd-order SGNs, which can be easily extended to build higher-order ones. Furthermore, these SGNs are used to expand the structural feature space of the underlying network, beneficial for network classification.

Linear time-delay feedback control of a pathological rhythm in a cardiac conduction model,Physical Review E,"This paper describes a method based on one-step linear time-delay feedback (LTDF) for suppressing a pathological period-2 rhythm (cardiac alternans) in an atrioventricular nodal conduction model. The LTDF controller is effective at suppressing alternans by stabilizing the map to one of a set of unstable fixed points. Additionally, we show that alternans can be prevented by tracking the period-1 rhythm past the point where bifurcation occurs, and that the method is robust to both measurement error and experimental noise.

Predicting network controllability robustness: A convolutional neural network approach,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,"Network controllability measures how well a networked system can be controlled to a target state, and its robustness reflects how well the system can maintain the controllability against malicious attacks by means of node removals or edge removals. The measure of network controllability is quantified by the number of external control inputs needed to recover or to retain the controllability after the occurrence of an unexpected attack.

A novel robust distributed extended Kalman filter, which can handle norm-bounded uncertainties in both the system model and its Taylor series expansion, is developed with ensured estimation performance. The filter is distributed in the sense that for each sensor, only its own measurements and its neighbors' information are utilized to optimize the upper bound of the estimation error covariance. Besides, a sufficient condition for the proposed algorithm is derived, which is simple and user-friendly since it depends on the property of the original nonlinear system instead of the estimation error covariance calculated at every step.

Control of chaotic dynamical systems using radial basis function network approximators,Information sciences,"This paper presents a general control method based on radial basis function networks (RBFNs) for chaotic dynamical systems. For many chaotic systems that can be decomposed into a sum of a linear and a nonlinear part, under some mild conditions the RBFN can be used to well approximate the nonlinear part of the system dynamics. The resulting system is then dominated by the linear part, with some small or weak residual nonlinearities due to the RBFN approximation errors. Thus, a simple linear state-feedback controller can be devised, to drive the system response to a desirable set-point. In addition to some theoretical analysis, computer simulations on two representative continuous-time chaotic systems (the Duffing and the Lorenz systems) are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",00200255,7.887

Inelastic nonuniform torsion of steel I-beams,Journal of Constructional Steel Research,"This paper presents a finite element model for analysing the elastic-plastic nonuniform torsion behaviour of thin-walled steel I-beams. The model uses Vlasov's warping strain model to represent warping torsion, and a mitre model for uniform torsion. The mitre model allows the representation at the tips of flanges of the transverse uniform torsion shear stresses.
For elastic-plastic analysis, the incremental theory of plasticity is adopted, employing the Prandtl-Reuss flow rule and the von Mises yield criterion. The material state determination algorithm and the variable arc-length method are also employed to improve the accuracy and reliability of the solutions. The numerical integration over the cross-section is carried out by dividing it into a number of triangular areas and then applying the no-bias area-coordinate Gaussian numerical integration scheme.

Security analysis of a distributed networked system under eavesdropping attacks,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,"In this brief, we consider the security problem for a network of linear time-invariant dynamical systems under eavesdropping attacks, where an eavesdropper can measure the states of some nodes in the network. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the eavesdropper to reveal the states of the networked system. We also present some necessary conditions for the case when the network has tail nodes or at least one node not monitored by the eavesdropper. In addition, we investigate several typical network structures and show that the networked system can be completely observed provided that the eavesdropper can monitor one node in each cycle. Further, we characterize the minimal set of necessarily monitored nodes with the upper bound set of such nodes. Finally, we verify the theoretical results by numerical simulations.","15497747, 15583791",4.475

On the security of the Yi-Tan-Siew chaotic cipher,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,"This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on the security of the Yi-Tan-Siew chaotic cipher.

Also, some security problems about the sub-keys /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/ are clarified, from both theoretical and experimental points of view. Further analysis shows that the security of this cipher is independent of the use of the chaotic tent map, once the sub-key K is removed via the proposed suggested differential chosen-plaintext attack.","15497747, 15583791",4.475

Controllability of Kronecker product networks,Automatica,"A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the controllability of Kronecker product networks, where the factor networks are general directed graphs. The condition explicitly illustrates how the controllability of the factor networks affects the controllability of the composite network. For the special case where at least one factor network is diagonalizable, an easily-verifiable condition is explicitly expressed. Furthermore, the controllability of higher-dimensional multi-agent systems is revisited, revealing that some controllability criterion reported in the literature does not hold. Consequently, a modified necessary and sufficient condition is established. The effectiveness of the new conditions is demonstrated through several examples.",00051098,5.44
Controllability of directed networked MIMO systems with heterogeneous dynamics,IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems,"This article studies the controllability of networked multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems, in which the network topology is weighted and directed, and the nodes are heterogeneous higher-dimensional linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems. The primary objective is to search for controllability criteria beyond those already known for networks with homogeneous dynamics. The focus is on the effects of the network topology, node dynamics, external control inputs, as well as the inner interactions on the network controllability. It is found that a network of heterogeneous systems can be controllable even if the underlying network topology is uncontrollable. The finding, thus, unravels another fundamental property that affects the network controllability-the heterogeneity of the node dynamics.

A separation principle for dynamical delayed output feedback control of chaos,Physics Letters A,"In this Letter, a dynamical delayed output-feedback (DDOF) control strategy is proposed for stabilizing unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) of chaotic systems. Using the Floquet theory, a separation principle is established which gives a necessary and sufficient stability condition for DDOF UPO stabilizing control systems.

Design and analysis of replica piecewise M-ary DCSK scheme for power line communications with asynchronous impulsive noise,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,"Previous studies have shown that impulsive noise can weaken the performance of power line communication (PLC). Though DCSK can improve the performance in an order of magnitude comparing to the direct sequence differential phase shift keying (DS-DPSK), it is still a challenge to further improve the BER performance with signal redesign without the need of advanced and expensive extra noise suppression technologies. The paper introduces the model of asynchronous impulsive noise of Middleton class-A noise and corresponding multipath fading channels in PLC, and analyzes the bit error rate (BER) performance of the M-ary differential chaos shift keying (MDCSK) scheme over different channels. Furthermore, a new replica piecewise frame of MDCSK (RP-MDCSK) is proposed to resist the impulse noise. In the proposed scheme, one piecewise of signals is transmitted first.

Choosing effective controlled nodes for scale-free network synchronization,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"Previous studies concerning pinning control of complex-network synchronization have very often demonstrated that in an unweighted symmetrical scale-free network, controlling the high-degree nodes is more efficient than controlling randomly chosen ones; due to the heterogeneity of the node-degree or edge-connection distribution of the scale-free network, small-degree nodes have relatively high probabilities of being chosen at random but their control has less influence on the other nodes through the network. This raises the question of whether or not controlling the high-degree nodes is always better than controlling the small ones in scale-free networks. Our answer to this is yes and no. In this study, we carry out extensive numerical simulations to show that in an unweighted symmetrical Barabasi–Albert scale-free network, when the portion of controlled nodes is relatively large, controlling the small nodes …",03784371,3.098

Appointed-time and attack-free bipartite synchronization of generic linear multiagent systems over directed switching networks,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"This article derives a solution to the appointed-time and attack-free bipartite synchronization problem for generic linear multiagent systems over directed switching networks accommodating cooperative and antagonistic interactions. Herein, appointed-time means that the settling time is independent of any parameters and is preappointed in advance. Attack-free requires that the communication channel is protected, which means that no state and observer information exchange is allowed, and only measured relative output information is available when designing protocols. Firstly, by virtue of Pontryagin’s maximum principle, a distributed appointed-time state-feedback protocol is developed for directed switching networks, which tackles the appointed-time bipartite synchronization problem from a motion-planning approach based on sampling measurements, but takes the risk of facing cyber attacks on information …","00189286, 15582523",6.496
Simplification of chaotic circuits with quadratic nonlinearity,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,"Typically, a chaotic system with quadratic terms is realized based on integral summation circuits, where however operational amplifiers and multipliers are usually overused. In this brief, a new approach for simplifying such circuit implementation is proposed utilizing the inherent characteristics of a multiplier. As a result, a chaotic system with quadratic terms is realized using only a few multipliers combined with some passive linear elements. In some circumstances, an operational amplifier is employed with simple linear feedback in case the multiplier is overloaded. This simplification of chaotic circuits makes chaos generation more easily implementable, cost-effective, and hence practical for chaos-based communications.","15497747, 15583791",4.475
Dynamic transport: From bifurcation to multistability,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"Complex dynamic evolution may originate from parameter-controlled bifurcation or initial-condition-oriented multistability.

Differential permutation index DCSK modulation for chaotic communication system,IEEE Communications Letters,"This letter proposes a differential permutation index differential chaos shift keying (DPI-DCSK) modulation for wireless communications.

A self-learning information diffusion model for smart social networks,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,"In this big data era, more and more social activities are digitized thereby becoming traceable, and thus the studies of social networks attract increasing attention from academia. It is widely believed that social networks play important role in the process of information diffusion. However, the opposite question, i.e., how does information diffusion process rebuild social networks, has been largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a new framework for understanding this reversing effect. Specifically, we first introduce a novel information diffusion model on social networks, by considering two types of individuals, i.e., smart and normal individuals, and two kinds of messages, true and false messages. Since social networks consist of human individuals, who have self-learning ability, in such a way that the trust of an individual to one of its neighbors increases (or decreases) if this individual received a true (or false) message …",23274697,6.997

By using tools from matrix analysis and switching systems theory, it is shown that this consensus problem can be cast to the stability problem of a set of low-dimensional switching systems. It is then proved that there exists a protocol guaranteeing consensus if the communication rate is larger than a threshold value and the communication topology contains a directed spanning tree.

Stability of switched systems on randomly switching durations with random interaction matrices,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"In this paper, we investigate the almost sure stability of switched systems on randomly switching durations simultaneously with randomly switching interaction matrices. We not only allow the interaction matrix on each switching duration to take values randomly from either a countable, an uncountable, or even an unbounded state space, but also allow the corresponding probability density function to be time varying with the switching. We provide an example to show the difference between the almost sure stability and the moment stability. Then, we establish several practical stability criteria for switched systems, which may have linear or nonlinear subsystems. These stability criteria also enable us to find suitable conditions for realizing almost sure synchronization in complex networks, such as small-world networks, with both randomly switching durations and a few switching couplings that take values randomly in …","00189286, 15582523",6.496

A parameter-perturbation method for chaos control to stabilizing UPOs,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,"A new method is developed for controlling chaos in discrete systems by perturbing one of its parameters in the neighborhood of an unstable periodic orbit (UPO). For 2-D systems, only two changes in the parameter value are needed in order to stabilize a UPO embedded in the chaotic attractor. The method is general and can be applied to any discrete chaotic system, in which a parameter is accessible and can be changed around a nominal value. To validate and visualize the applicability of the method, an electronic circuit is designed, which resembles the dynamics of the Hénon system, and the control scheme is successfully tested on this circuit.

A reinforcement learning-based algorithm for deflection routing in optical burst-switched networks,2013 IEEE 14th international conference on information reuse & integration (IRI),"In this paper, we propose a Q-learning based deflection routing algorithm that may be employed to resolve contention in optical burst-switched networks. The main goal of deflection routing is to successfully deflect a burst based only on a limited knowledge that network nodes possess about their environment. Q-learning, one of the reinforcement learning algorithms, has been proposed in the past to help generate deflection decisions. The complexity of existing reinforcement learning-based deflection routing algorithms depends on the number of nodes in the network. The proposed algorithm scales well for larger networks because its complexity depends on the node degree rather than the network size. The algorithm is implemented using the ns-3 network simulator.

Design and implementation of compound chaotic attractors,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"This paper reports an autonomous-system-based approach for creating compound chaotic attractors from a class of generalized Lorenz systems via switching control. A state variable scale transformation is proposed for these systems to ensure that all attractors have comparable sizes. Coordinate transformation in the z-axis direction is also used, so that every pair of adjacent chaotic attractors have a common connected domain in the same phase space. Then, by switching control, the intended compound chaotic attractors can be generated. A circuit for a compound Lorenz–Chen–Lü chaotic attractor is designed and implemented for demonstration, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed simulation-based technique.

The epidemic thresholds related to the vaccination rate, the vaccination-invalid rate and the vaccination success rate on scale-free networks are demonstrated, showing different results from the reported observations. This reveals that whether or not the epidemic can spread over a network under vaccination control is determined not only by the network structure but also by the medicine's effective duration. Moreover, for a given infective rate, the proportion of individuals to vaccinate can be calculated theoretically for the case that the recovered nodes have immunity.

When the system dimension increases, the solution to switch-based ADP is made prohibitive by the exponentially increasing structure of the value function approximator and by the exponentially increasing modes. This technical correspondence proposes a distributed computational method for solving switch-based ADP.

Then, since sometimes the synchronizability can be enhanced by changing the network structure, the question of whether the networks with more edges are easier to synchronize is addressed. Based on a subgraph and complementary graph method, it is shown by examples that the answer is negative even if the network structure is arbitrarily optimized. This reveals that generally there are redundant edges in a network, which not only make no contributions to synchronization but actually may reduce the synchronizability. Moreover, a simple example shows that the node betweenness centrality is not always a good indicator for the network synchronizability. Finally, some more examples are …",16741056,1.504

Classification-based prediction of network connectivity robustness,Neural Networks,"Today, there is an increasing concern about malicious attacks on various networks in society and industry, against which the network robustness is critical. Network connectivity robustness, in particular, is of fundamental importance, which is generally measured by a sequence of calculated values that indicate the connectedness of the remaining network after a sequence of attacks by means of node- or edge-removal. It is computationally time-consuming, however, to measure and evaluate the network connectivity robustness using the conventional attack simulations, especially for large-scale networked systems.

Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, it is found that the capacity characteristics of the non‐coherent DCSK system are significantly different from those of the coherent case. It is shown that there are different capacity bounds corresponding to different spreading factor values. Optimal code rates are found, which minimise the required bit signal‐to‐noise ratio for a reliable communication system, and they are increasing with the increase of the spreading factor value over an AWGN channel while decreasing over a Rayleigh fading channel.

Propagation dynamics of an epidemic model with infective media connecting two separated networks of populations,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"Based on the fact that most human pathogens originate from animals, this paper attempts to illustrate the propagation dynamics of some zoonotic infections, which spread in two separated networks of populations (human network I and animal network II) and cross-species (vectors, or infective media).

Spectral coarse graining of complex clustered networks,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"Synchronization in complex dynamical networks is in the focus of network science today, where intensive efforts have been devoted to understanding its mechanisms and developing basic theories with applications.

Chaotifying continuous-time nonlinear autonomous systems,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Based on the principle of chaotification for continuous-time autonomous systems, which relies on two basic properties of chaos, i.e. being globally bounded with necessary positive-zero-negative Lyapunov exponents, this paper derives a feasible and unified chaotification method for designing a general chaotic continuous-time autonomous nonlinear system. For a system consisting of a linear and a nonlinear subsystems, chaotification is achieved using separation of state variables, which decomposes the system into two open-loop subsystems interacting through mutual feedback resulting in an overall closed-loop nonlinear feedback system.

Design of coupling functions for global synchronization of uncertain chaotic dynamical networks,Physics Letters A,"This Letter investigates the design of coupling functions for global synchronization of uncertain dynamical networks. Some coupling functions are constructed for ensuring the states of an uncertain dynamical network to globally asymptotically synchronize with any desired state of an isolate node of the network. In the design, the coupling functions are not required to be symmetric or linear. Even if the isolate node of the network is uncertain, global synchronization of the entire network can still be achieved. In particular, the proposed scheme can overcome the major shortcoming of some nearest-neighbor coupled dynamical networks, i.e., it cannot synchronize if the network size is sufficiently large. Finally, using Chua's chaotic circuit as the nodes of the network, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified.","00036951, 10773118",3.462

Scalable consensus filtering for uncertain systems over sensor networks with Round‐Robin protocol,International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control,"This article is concerned with the scalable distributed H∞‐consensus filtering problem for a class of discrete time‐varying systems over sensor networks with the Round‐Robin protocol (RRP). The challenge comes from the fact that the time‐varying parameters of the network are subject to randomly occurring norm‐bounded uncertainties and the measurement outputs of the sensor nodes are saturated due to the sector nonlinearities. For preventing data collisions and saving energy, the RRP determines which neighboring node can access the shared network for information transmission at each time step.

Theoretical and experimental studies state that the p53-Mdm2 network constitutes the core module of regulatory interactions activated by cellular stress induced by a variety of signaling pathways. In this paper, a strategy to control the p53-Mdm2 network regulated by p14ARF is developed, based on the pinning control technique, which consists into applying local feedback controllers to a small number of nodes (pinned ones) in the network. Pinned nodes are selected on the basis of their importance level in a topological hierarchy, their degree of connectivity within the network, and the biological role they perform.

Detailed conversions are worked out for typical discrete chaotic maps (logistic, Hénon) and continuous flows (Rösller, Lorenz) for illustration. This unifies the two seemingly different approaches from the physics and the engineering communities on chaos control.

Strict intuitionistic fuzzy distance/similarity measures based on Jensen-Shannon divergence,Information Sciences,"Being a pair of dual concepts, the normalized distance and similarity measures are important tools for decision-making and pattern recognition under the intuitionistic fuzzy set framework. In this paper, we first construct some counterexamples to illustrate that two existing similarity measures do not meet the axiomatic definition of intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measures. We then show that (1) these two measures cannot effectively distinguish some intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs); (2) except for the endpoints, there exist infinitely many pairs of IFVs, where the maximum distance “1” can be achieved under these two distances, leading to counter-intuitive results. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce the concept of strict intuitionistic fuzzy distance measure (SIFDisM) and strict intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measure (SIFSimM), and propose an improved intuitionistic fuzzy distance measure based on Jensen-Shannon …",00200255,7.887
Sampled-data-based consensus of multi-agent systems with multiplicative noise and time-delays,Information Sciences,"The sampled-data-based consensus control problem of multi-agent systems (MASs) with multiplicative noise and time-delays is studied in this paper. The MASs are given in a continuous-time setting while information exchange occurs only at the sampling instants. Therefore, the traditional methods for continuous-time or discrete-time models are not applicable. To resolve the problem, a discretization-reconnection method is developed to investigate the consensus control of first-order and second-order MASs, respectively. Some sufficient conditions, explicitly related to the control gains and the sampling step size, are established for both mean-square (m.s.) and almost sure (a.s.) consensus. Under these conditions, consensus can be achieved by designing appropriate control gains and the sampling step size for MASs with given noise intensity and time-delays.

Searching better rewiring strategies and objective functions for stronger controllability robustness,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,"Rewiring is a common strategy for enhancing the controllability robustness of complex networks. In this brief, rewiring strategies including the degree-preserving strategy, underlying-topology-preserving strategy, and unconstrained-rewiring strategy, are compared and analyzed. Since measuring the true controllability-robustness values by simulations is time-consuming hence impractical, three surrogates are proposed for improvement, namely initial controllability, critical nodes exposure, and network heterogeneity. Combinations of rewiring strategies and objective functions are compared to the random edge-rectification strategy.

Rich dynamics and anticontrol of extinction in a prey–predator system,Nonlinear Dynamics,"This paper reveals some new and rich dynamics of a two-dimensional prey–predator system and to anticontrol the extinction of one of the species. For a particular value of the bifurcation parameter, one of the system variable dynamics is going to extinct, while another remains chaotic. To prevent the extinction, a simple anticontrol algorithm is applied so that the system or bits can escape from the vanishing trap. As the bifurcation parameter increases, the system presents quasiperiodic, stable, chaotic and also hyperchaotic orbits. Some of the chaotic attractors are Kaplan–Yorke type, in the sense that the sum of its Lyapunov exponents is positive. Also, atypically for undriven discrete systems, it is numerically found that, for some small parameter ranges, the system seemingly presents strange nonchaotic attractors.

Random walks in generalized delayed recursive trees,Chinese Physics B,"Recently a great deal of effort has been made to explicitly determine the mean first-passage time (MFPT) between two nodes averaged over all pairs of nodes on a fractal network. In this paper, we first propose a family of generalized delayed recursive trees characterized by two parameters, where the existing nodes have a time delay to produce new nodes. We then study the MFPT of random walks on this kind of recursive tree and investigate the effect of the time delay on the MFPT. By relating random walks to electrical networks, we obtain an exact formula for the MFPT and verify it by numerical calculations. Based on the obtained results, we further show that the MFPT of delayed recursive trees is much shorter, implying that the efficiency of random walks is much higher compared with the non-delayed counterpart.

A simplified optimal control method for homoclinic bifurcations,Nonlinear Dynamics,"A simplified optimal control method is presented for controlling or suppressing homoclinic bifurcations of general nonlinear oscillators with one degree-of-freedom. The simplification is based on the addition of an adjustable parameter and a superharmonic excitation in the force term. By solving an optimization problem for the optimal amplitude coefficients of the harmonic and superharmonic excitations to be used as the controlled parameters, the force term as the controller can be designed. By doing so, the control gain and small optimal amplitude coefficients can be obtained at lowest cost. As the adjustable parameter decreases, a gain of some amplitude coefficient ratio is increased to the highest degree, which means that the region where homoclinic intersection does not occur will be enlarged as much as possible, leading to the best possible control performance.

Controlling halo-chaos via wavelet-based feedback,Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society,"Halo-chaos in high-current accelerator has become one of the key issues because it can cause excessive radioactivity from the accelerators and significantly limits the applications of the new accelerators in industrial and other fields.

Real‐time chaotic circuit stabilization via inverse optimal control,International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications,"In this paper, an efficient approach is developed for real‐time global asymptotic stabilization of the chaotic Chen's circuit, as a typical example for chaotic circuit control. Based on a recently introduced methodology of inverse optimal control for nonlinear systems, a very simple stabilization control law, a linear state feedback, is electronically implemented for the desired global asymptotic stabilization. Both Chen's chaotic system and the designed controller are synthesized and realized by analog electronic components, with the aim of evaluating the physical performance of the real‐time control law and demonstrating the practicality of the control method, which is robust to some input uncertainties.

The theory of Smax graph does not seem to work in a real case study,"Dynamics of Continuous, Discrete and Impulsive Systems Series B: Applications and Algorithms","A recent study has shown that the power-law degree distribution alone may not guarantee a network be scale-free. Meanwhile, a structural metric was formulated to represent the extent to which a network is scale-free, where a new concept of s max graph was suggested, associated with a measure of a network being fully scale-free. Following this approach, in our recent investigation of a real competitive relationship network of enterprises in the software industry in Guangzhou city, China, we constructed and analyzed the s max graph of the real network, hoping that this case study could help us confirm the seemingly attractive new theory. It turns out, however, that the concept of s max graph does not preserve many essential features of the real network. To that end, the main reason for the failure of the original concept of s max graph is discussed, with a possible remedy suggested for future research. Copyright© 2006 Watam Press.",14928760,0.553

Generalized TODIM method based on symmetric intuitionistic fuzzy Jensen–Shannon divergence,Expert Systems with Applications,"Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) theory has become main approach to representing imprecision and vagueness. The IF divergence measure (IFDivM) based on Jensen–Shannon divergence is perhaps the most widely used measure to compare the similarity of multiple intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs).

Sensor scheduling design for complex networks under a distributed state estimation framework,Automatica,"This paper investigates sensor scheduling for state estimation of complex networks over shared transmission channels.

On the stability of networked impulsive control systems,International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control,"In this paper, the stability of linear networked impulsive control systems is studied. The data dropout rate over N steps (DRNS) is defined, and the maximal allowable DRNS is computed, which provides a guideline for the system stability in the sense that, if the actual DRNS is less than this maximal value, then the system is asymptotically stable. To handle the network‐induced delays, a propagation unit based on the system model is introduced to the system. A necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotical stability of the networked system with the propagation unit is derived. Furthermore, networked linearized impulsive control systems suffering from both transmission delays and data dropouts are also investigated. To design proper impulsive controllers for such systems, some algorithms are further proposed based on LMI techniques and V‐K iteration approaches.

Controllability analysis for a class of piecewise nonlinear impulsive non‐autonomous systems,International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control,"This article investigates the controllability for a class of piecewise nonlinear impulsive non‐autonomous systems. The problem is addressed by considering the nonlinearities and impulses as perturbations. First, a standard framework is introduced to transform the issue of controllability to the existence of a fixed point by designing a proper admissible control and constructing a nonlinear operator on a Banach space. Then, two sufficient controllability conditions for such systems are developed by employing Schauder's and Rothe's fixed point theorems when the perturbations satisfy several nonlinear constraints including linear/sublinear growth conditions, bounded constraints, and Lipschitz conditions. It is shown that the controllability of such systems is influenced by the linear parts, the nonlinear perturbations, and the impulsive effects.

Joint coding/decoding optimization for DC-BICM system: Collaborative design,IEEE Communications Letters,"Differential chaotic bit-interleaved coded modulation (DC-BICM) system can achieve coding gain from channel code without loss of bandwidth in the differential chaos shift keying (DCSK) system, but the current DC-BICM system using the belief propagation decoding algorithm has high decoding complexity, which brings burdens to resource-limited applications.

Invulnerability of planar two-tree networks,Theoretical Computer Science,"Let us model the network by an undirected graph G, in which each edge fails independently with probability q∈[0, 1], the all-terminal reliability of the network is the probability that the graph G remains connected and it is one of the important measure for the invulnerability of the network.

Up now we cannot find any results for some special classes of the planar networks. This paper studies the all-terminal reliability of the two-tree networks and its generalizations.

On the initial function space of time-delayed systems: A time-delayed feedback control perspective,Journal of the Franklin Institute,"We address the problem as if the initial function space of a time-delayed system can be finite-dimensional. We argue that the dimension of the initial function space of a time-delayed feedback control system is just identical to that of the corresponding plant which is to be controlled, and so is finite-dimensional in many cases. We prove this property by constructing an injection map between the two spaces. We anticipate that this may also be applied to some other systems, such as ecological processes involving time delays without control. We believe that the significance of this discovery not only makes available the physical interpretation and intuitional explanation of the basins of attraction associated with time-delayed feedback control, but also suggests the principle as how to evaluate the robustness of the time-delayed feedback control schemes to external disturbances.

The effects of the network topology, pinning density and pinning strength on the network synchronizability are examined through extensive numerical simulations.

Jittering performance of random deflection routing in packet networks,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"This paper reports a study of random deflection routing protocol and its impact on delay-jitter over packet networks. In case of congestion, routers with a random deflection routing protocol can forward incoming packets to links laying off shortest paths; namely, packets can be “deflected” away from their original paths. However, random deflection routing may send packets to several different paths, thereby introducing packet re-ordering. This could affect the quality of receptions, it could also impair the overall performance in transporting data traffic. Nevertheless, the present study reveals that deflection routing could actually reduce delay-jitter when the traffic loading on the network is not heavy.",10075704,3.864
Author’s reply to: Comment on “Existence of heteroclinic orbits of the Shil’nikov type in a 3D quadratic autonomous chaotic system”[J. Math. Anal. Appl. 315 (2006) 106–119],J. Math. Anal. Appl.,"1. It is well known that rigorously proving the existence of a heteroclinic orbit in a three-or higher-dimensional autonomous dynamical system is extremely difficult. As a matter of fact, there is not much success reported in the literature, where a typical approach is based on qualitative analysis with approximation. Our paper [2] follows this common approach and uses the technique developed in [3] to construct an approximate heteroclinic orbit of the system (2.1) in [2](ie (1) in [1]). Since the Shil’nikov criteria are concerned only with the eigenvalues of the system Jacobians at two equilibrium points but not the orbital properties in between the two equilibria, a series expansion [2, Eq.(4.10)] as an approximation to the orbit is reasonable and acceptable if it satisfies the Shil’nikov criteria at the two equilibria.
2. We have checked Eqs.(4.9) and (4.20) in [2] again and confirmed that our derivations therein are correct. 3. We did not discuss the convergence property of series (4.20) but used ϕ (t) to approximate x (t), consequently both y (t) and z (t) are approximations. Therefore, we cannot say that the series (4.20) will not converge to±δ in an oscillatory fashion. But if it does, then x (t) may indeed follow an unstable manifold to spiral out from A3 to approach A2. However, this may not happen to the specific system (2.1) of [2](ie (1) in [1]). At least, it was not observed by us. This possibility is only graphically described in [1], which nevertheless is not a rigorous proof. If the authors of [1] would like to argue that this actually happens to our specific system in question, then it is expected that they give a mathematical proof or provide a concrete counterexample, not just …","0022247X, 10960813",1.396

By combining the ideas of collective potential functions and velocity consensus, a connectivity-preserving flocking algorithm with bounded potential function is proposed. Using tools from algebraic graph theory and matrix analysis, it is shown that the present algorithm can enable the group of multiple agents to move with the same velocity while preserving the connectivity of the whole network if the the algebraic connectivity of the initial network is larger than a threshold value. Furthermore, the flocking algorithm is used to solve the flocking problem of multi-agent systems with a virtual leader by adding a navigation feedback term.

H2 norm accumulation and its impact on synchronisation of complex dynamical networks,International journal of control,"This article addresses the H 2 norm accumulation problem of linearly coupled dynamical networks. An interesting outer-coupling relationship is constructed, under which the H 2 norm of the newly constructed network with column-input and row-output matrices increases exponentially fast in terms of the node number N: it increases generally much faster than 2 N when N is large while the H 2 norm of each node is 1. However, the H 2 norm of the network with a diffusive coupling is equal to γ2 N, i.e. increasing only linearly, when the network is stable, where γ2 is the H 2 norm of a single node. And the H 2 norm of the network with antisymmetrical coupling also increases, but rather slowly, with respect to the node number N. Other networks with block-diagonal-input and block-diagonal-output matrices behave similarly. It demonstrates that the changes of H 2 norms in different networks are very complicated, despite the …",17505836,5.063

Generalized snap-back repeller and semi-conjugacy to shift operators of piecewise continuous transformations,Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems,"In this paper, we attempt to clarify an open problem related to a generalization of the snap-back repeller. Constructing a semi-conjugacy from the finite product of a transformation f: Rn→ R n on an invariant set Λ to a sub-shift of the finite type on a w-symbolic space, we show that the corresponding transformation associated with the generalized snap-back repeller on Rn exhibits chaotic dynamics in the sense of having a positive topological entropy. The argument leading to this conclusion also shows that a certain kind of degenerate transformations, admitting a point in the unstable manifold of a repeller mapping back to the repeller, have positive topological entropies on the orbits of their invariant sets. An illustrative example is provided to show that chaotic degenerate transformations are omnipresent. Furthermore, two feasible sufficient conditions for obtaining an unstable manifold are presented.

Design of near-optimal linear digital tracking filters with colored input,Journal of computational and applied mathematics,"The well-known Kalman filter is an optimal linear recursive digital data processing scheme and is widely used in practice. However, it has certain disadvantages such as the complexity in calculations and has, therefore, somewhat limited applications, especially when colored noise input is considered. In real-time tracking, for example, it is usually necessary to sacrifice optimality for physical feasibility and to use the third order linear predictor-corrector filter, or commonly known as the apy filter instead. In this paper, we discuss a near-optimal linear recursive digital tracking filter with colored input. When white noise input processes are considered, this filter was discussed in [3] and is obtained, following an idea of Green and Shepherd of White Sands Missile Range [4], by choosing the gain matrix as the limit of the sequence of Kalman gain matrices. Here, we treat the colored noise input by using an augmented system. As is well known, this may lead to a singular error covariance matrix when Kalman filtering processes are considered (cf.[7]). One of the advantages of our near-optimal linear digital tracking filter is that the singularity of the error covariance matrix can be avoided entirely by choosing appropriate parameters. Another advantage. is its simplicity in calculation and application. Since its tracking performance is near-optimal in dealing with large sample sizes and will be seen to be independent of the sampling time, and since it applies both to white and colored noise input processes very efficiently, it is hoped that the near-optimal filter discussed in this paper, which is a generalization of that in [3], will attract the attention of both researchers …",03770427,2.48

Fully distributed prescribed-time bipartite synchronization of general linear systems: An adaptive gain scheduling strategy,Automatica,"Investigating the prescribed-time synchronization problem for multiple linear agents is challenging because the states and inputs of the system are coupled through the state-input matrix pair.

First, the strategy converts the problem to a time-varying parameter design problem using a time-varying parametric Lyapunov equation (TVPLE). By exploiting the time-varying solution to TVPLE for designing the feedback gains, prescribed-time bipartite synchronization protocols are designed for systems over undirected and directed networks, respectively. These protocols require some global information; therefore, edge- and node-based adaptive gain scheduling strategies are further developed to achieve the prescribed-time bipartite synchronization in a fully distributed manner …",00051098,5.44

In this paper, a hybrid approximation (HyA) method is proposed to estimate the controllability robustness performance of large-scale directed random-graph (RG) networks under random edge-removal attacks. HyA sufficiently utilizes the similarity between the generation mechanism of the RG networks and the destructing process of random edge-removal attacks. Two threshold values are set to classify general RG networks as ‘dense’, ‘sparse’, or ‘median’, according to the average degree of each network. A two-phase approximation is applied to ‘sparse’ RG networks, while different three-phase approximations are …","15986446, 20054092",3.098

Protograph bit-interleaved coded modulation: A bandwidth-efficient design paradigm for 6G wireless communications,Physical Communication,"Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) has attracted considerable attention from the research community in the past three decades, because it can achieve desirable error performance with relatively low implementation complexity for a large number of communication and storage systems.

Neural pinning control for adaptive trajectory tracking of complex dynamical networks,Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences,"In this paper, a pinning control scheme for adaptive trajectory tracking of networked nonlinear systems is proposed. The desired trajectory tracking objective is achieved via a novel adaptive control strategy, in which the existing concept of pinning control is extended to an adaptive pinning control.

The combined pinning‐neural features in tracking control constitute the novelty of this approach. The proposed control law operates properly with a different reference along with unknown dynamics and coupling variations. In contrast to the linearization approach, less restrictive assumptions for node dynamics are imposed.

Bifurcation analysis of a class of generalized Hénon maps with hidden dynamics,IEEJ Transactions on Electrical and Electronic Engineering,"Although continuous systems such as the Chua circuit are known as systems with hidden attractors, hidden attractors also exist in classical discrete maps, such as a generalized Hénon map.

A distributed algorithm for tracking general functions of multiple signals not-necessarily having steady states,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,"This brief exploits the possibility of devising an algorithm for tracking a general function pertaining to multiple signals from a multi-agent system in a distributed sense, where each agent has access to one single signal. Each agent's input relies solely on local neighboring information, from which some conditions on the gain parameters, the reference signals, along with the general function, are derived such that the tracking objective is attainable. The algorithm is well-defined as long as the gradient of the general function with respect to agents' states has a uniform lower bound. Under mild conditions, it is shown that the devised system is able to track a general consensus function of multiple dynamic signals, including arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and root-mean square as special examples.

Modeling and experimental validation of the chaotic behavior of a robot whip,Journal of Mechanics,"Although the whip is a common tool that has been used for thousands of years, there have been very few studies on its dynamic behavior. With the advance of modern technology, designing and building soft- body robot whips has become feasible. This paper presents a study on the modeling and experimental testing of a robot whip. The robot whip is modeled using a Pseudo-Rigid-Body Model (PRBM). The PRBM consists of a number of pseudo-rigid-links and pseudo-revolute-joints just like a multi-linkage pendulum. Because of its large number of degrees of freedom (DOF) and inherited underactuation, the robot whip exhibits prominent transient chaotic behavior. In particular, depending on the initial driving force, the chaos may start sooner or later, but will die down because of the gravity and air damping. The dynamic model is validated by experiments.

RED-f routing protocol for complex networks,2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),"In this paper, we address routing in complex networks. Routing traffic across a network requires finding best possible paths between sources and destinations. When data traffic changes dynamically, a path that was optimal in the past may not be the best for the next packet. Adapting to traffic changes and finding optimal paths dynamically are challenging tasks. They become more demanding in large and complex networks. In optical burst switching (OBS) networks, two optical bursts contending for the same link need resolution mechanisms other than queueing. Deflection routing protocols are used to override routing tables and “deflect” one of the bursts to a free link. Instead of deflecting bursts at an immediate point of contention, the proposed Random Early Deflection (RED-f) routing protocol triggers deflection ahead of time and, thus, offers additional routing paths and lowers the burst loss rate due to contention …",-,153.0

Can state feedback stabilize a chaotic orbit uniformly and asymptotically in the sense of orbital stability?,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","In this Letter, we show that it is impossible to uniformly and asymptotically stabilize a chaotic orbit (in the sense of the classical orbital stability) by using state feedback control, for both discrete and continuous autonomous systems, if the autonomous chaotic system has a continuous vector field and the controller is a continuous function of the system state.

The convergence properties and error estimates of such schemes are obtained to provide a theoretical basis for gauging the utility of using the above approximations of the Kalman gain matrix at each time instant. A new exponentially convergent scheme is also suggested for approximating the inverse matrix within the Kalman gain.

Distributed resource allocation over multiple interacting coalitions: a game-theoretic approach,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"Despite the fact that many distributed re- source allocation (DRA) algorithms have been reported in the literature, it is still unknown how to allocate resources optimally over multiple interacting coalitions. One major challenge in solving such a problem is that the relevance of one coalition's decision to other coalitions' benefits may lead to conflicts of interest among these coalition- s. Within this context, a new game model is formulated in the present note, termed as resource allocation game, where each coalition contains multiple agents cooperating to maximize the coalition-level benefit subject to an intra- coalition resource constraint described by a coupled equal- ity.

An Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning: A Continuous Zero-Determinant Strategy Approach,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,"As a representative emerging machine learning technique, federated learning (FL) has gained considerable popularity for its special feature of “making data available but not visible”. However, potential problems remain, including privacy breaches, imbalances in payment, and inequitable distribution. These shortcomings let devices reluctantly contribute relevant data to, or even refuse to participate in FL. Therefore, in the application of FL, an important but also challenging issue is to motivate as many participants as possible to provide high-quality data to FL. In this paper, we propose an incentive mechanism for FL based on the continuous zero-determinant (CZD) strategies from the perspective of game theory.

Complex dynamical behaviors of deflection routing on grid networks,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Deflection routing is a mechanism to route packets away from congestion. Traditional shortest path routing uses only the static topological information as input, whereas deflection routing takes into account the dynamic queue length information. In the simplest form of deflection routing, a packet being dropped due to queue buffer overflow is ""rescued"" and is rerouted to other links. Deflection routing can thus reduce the rate of packet drops and allow a network to carry more packets without the need of additional bandwidth. However, it can also lead to unstable deflecting behavior in some congestion scenario. It is important to study deflection behavior when operating near the point of congestion. In this paper, the performance in terms of packet drop rate and traveling time are studied through extensive simulation, and complex behavior in the traffic with self-similarity property is observed and discussed.","02181274, 17936551",2.088

Slow Invariant Manifolds of Memristor-Based Chaotic Circuits,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"This work presents an efficient approach for computing the slow invariant manifold of the fourth-order canonical memristor-based Chua circuits using the flow curvature method. First, the magnetic-flux and charge characteristic curve is generated from the classical circuit with a piecewise-linear function. Then, the characteristic curve is generated from the circuit with the piecewise-linear function replaced by a cubic function. Further, the duality principle is applied to studying such memristor-based circuits in the three-dimensional flux-linkage and charge phase space and then in the four-dimensional current–voltage phase space. It is demonstrated that the slow invariant manifolds of these fourth-order memristor-based chaotic circuits can be more directly computed for the first case than the second.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Null model-based data augmentation for graph classification,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,"Graph classification is an important task widely applied to biochemistry, social networks, and other fields. Since it is a data-dependent problem, insufficient training data will deteriorate the performance of graph classification models. To address this issue, various data augmentation methods have been proposed. However, most existing methods tend to destroy the topological features, leading to a negative impact on information propagation and semantics. While the null model generates new data with the same topological features as the original graph and helps capture the latent information based on topology. Hence, combining the null model with data augmentation for graph classification may be useful in helping models learn graph representations. This paper introduces a novel null model-based augmentation technique for graph classification. Specifically, four standard and four approximate null model-based …",23274697,6.997
Computing persistent homology by spanning trees and critical simplices,Research,"Topological data analysis can extract effective information from higher-dimensional data. Its mathematical basis is persistent homology. The persistent homology can calculate topological features at different spatiotemporal scales of the dataset, that is, establishing the integrated taxonomic relation among points, lines, and simplices. Here, the simplicial network composed of all-order simplices in a simplicial complex is essential. Because the sequence of nested simplicial subnetworks can be regarded as a discrete Morse function from the simplicial network to real values, a method based on the concept of critical simplices can be developed by searching all-order spanning trees. Employing this new method, not only the Morse function values with the theoretical minimum number of critical simplices can be obtained, but also the Betti numbers and composition of all-order cavities in the simplicial network can be …","00280836, 14764687",19.403

DeepInsight: Topology Changes Assisting Detection of Adversarial Samples on Graphs,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, a number of machine learning algorithms, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been proposed to facilitate network analysis or graph data mining.

This article investigates three well-known adversarial attack methods, i.e., Nettack, Meta Attack, and GradArgmax. It is found that different attack methods have their specific attack preferences on changing the target network structures. Such attack patterns are further verified by experimental results on some real-world networks, revealing that, generally, the top-4 most important network attributes on detecting adversarial samples suffice to explain the preference of an attack method.

Joint Space Decomposition-and-Synthesis Approach and Achievable DoF Regions for -User MIMO Interference Channels,IEEE transactions on signal processing,"The paper proposes a new approach of joint space decomposition-and-synthesis (JSDS) for deriving achievable degree-of-freedom (DoF) region by interference alignment without symbol extension for K-user MIMO interference channel. Solving the interference alignment problem is to find the precoders that align desired signal and interference with disjoint subspaces at receivers. A related property of these precoders is that the solution range for each one of them is a union of linear spaces, termed transmit spaces. Based on this property, the JSDS approach is developed to derive transmit spaces that fulfill alignment conditions. From this approach, achievable DoF regions for 2 and 3-user interference channels are obtained. The region for the 2-user channel is shown to coincide with the existing result of the DoF capacity of the channel.

Fuzzy logic approach to object recognition,Applications of Fuzzy Logic Technology,"In this paper, a linguistic approach to the problem of object recognition is outlined and fuzzy logic solution is given for this formulation. The problem under investigation is divided into two sub-problems: (1) feature extraction from a digitized image, and (2) matching features extracted against a set of pre-defined objects. Using linguistic approach, solving the problem of feature extraction yields a set of linguistic descriptions of an object from a particular digitized image. These descriptions will be matched with known patterns to derive a decision on the shape of the object. The use of fuzzy logic in matching patterns has been shown to provide satisfactory results in Monte Carlo simulations, especially in the case that there is ambiguity in the pictures.

The world literally stalled under this wrath of nature. This was the time when we lost John Horton Conway.
Who is John Conway to us? We are the students, researchers, and practitioners of Cellular Automata (CAs). All of us were practically introduced to cellular automaton (CA) through the Game of Life by our teachers. This Game of Life, sometimes simply known as Life, is a zero-player game developed by John Conway in 1970. Although historically CA was initiated by John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam in the 1940s, it was Conway’s Game of Life which popularized CA to the people beyond academia. The power of its simple rule to create an infinite world of possible complex patterns is bound to make everyone like us charmed and intrigued to know more about CAs and advertently come to do research on CAs. However, John Conway was not limited to only Game of Life. In fact, it is a very small shade of his life filled with contributions in different areas forming a colorful palette. Be it the Combinatorial game theory, Group theory, Number theory, Geometry, Geometric topology, Algebra, or Theoretical Physics, whatever area he had touched, a remarkable contribution on his name has remained there.

Differentiating complex network models: An engineering perspective,Computers & Mathematics with Applications,"Network models that can capture the underlying network’s topologies and functionalities are crucial for the development of complex network algorithms and protocols. In the engineering community, the performances of network algorithms and protocols are usually evaluated by running them on a network model. In most if not all reported work, the criteria used to determine such a network model rely on how close it matches the network data in terms of some basic topological characteristics. However, the intrinsic relations between a network topology and its functionalities are still unclear. A question arises naturally: For a network model which can reproduce some topological characteristics of the underlying network, is it reasonable and valid to use this model to be a test-bed for evaluating the network’s performances? To answer this question, we take a close look at several typical complex network models of the AS …",08981221,3.084
Occurrence and underlying mechanism of multi-stripe chaotic attractors,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals",This paper is concerned with the generation of multi-stripe chaotic attractors. Simple periodic nonlinear functions are employed to transform the original chaotic attractors to a pattern with multiple “parallel” or “rectangular” stripes. The relationship between the system parameters related to some periodic functions and the shape of the generated attractor is analyzed. Theoretic analysis about the underlying mechanism of generating the parallel stripes in the attractors is given.

Fuzzy-PID Controller is A Quasi-Sliding Mode Controller with Dual Features,International Journal of Fuzzy Systems,"Both linguistic and numerical analyses given in this paper show that PID-type fuzzy logic controllers (FLC) are quasi-sliding mode controllers with some dual properties as compared to their linear counterparts and the sliding modes of variable structure controllers (VSC). Mathematical models of FLC are derived for the quantitative analysis. These models reveal that the dual features can be adjusted by simply tuning scaling gains and membership functions (MFs) of the FLC. As VSC is usually advantageous for complex plants and processes while linear PID control is better for simpler ones, the influence of these dual features on FLC design and tuning is significant for complex systems. Nominal gains of an FLC can be first designed based on its well-tuned linear counterpart for a simpler process, and then be determined based on the VSC theory for a complex process. The optimal gains of the FLC can then be further …","15622479, 21993211",4.144

A new approach to automatic PID tuning: The large ζ tuning method,Computers in Education Journal,"Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers still represent the majority of the controllers used in industry today due to their effectiveness, robustness, low cost, and easy implementation. A properly designed and well tuned PID controller works well in many systems and processes. Therefore, automatic tuning of PID controllers has attracted great attention ever since their invention. This paper presents a new approach to the automatic tuning of PID controllers-the large ζ tuning method. This relatively simple tuning method can guarantee the desired maximum overshoot and rise time by tuning only one parameter. Simulations have been carried out for lower and higher order linear systems, timedelayed systems, and some nonlinear systems. Results have shown that this large ζ tuning method is also effective on systems with time-varying parameters. Comparisons among three methods, the popular Ziegler-Nichols method, the internal model control (IMC) method, and the large ζ tuning method indicate that the proposed method performs as well as (if not better than) the other two methods. Also, it provides smaller controller gains in general, and acts as a closed-loop tuning method. Therefore, the large ζ tuning is a new closed-loop tuning method that offers a simple and effective way for automatic tuning of PID controllers, and is competitive to other existing self-tuning methods.",10693769,0.2
On Hankel-norm approximation of large-scale Markov chains,American Control Conference,"Large-scale Markov chains have many applications in stochastic systems control, power networks and signal/image processing. In this paper, we study a model reduction problem for large-scale Markov chains under an optimal Hankel-norm criterion to establish stable lower-dimensional models in closed form. We first modify a special technique suggested by Krichagina, Liptser, and Rubinovich (1985) from one-dimensional to multi-dimensional Markov processes and reformulate a given large-scale Markov chain to a multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant (LTI) stochastic system. Since the resulting MIMO LTI stochastic system also has a very high dimension, model reduction is necessary for the purpose of performing linear estimation techniques such as the Kalman filtering to obtain an optimal estimate for the given Markov chain. Under the commonly used minimum (error) Hankel-norm criterion, we obtain a stable lower-dimensional optimal approximation in closed form.",07431619,2900.0

Because of the random and inhomogeneous nature of the ocean, not only the amplitude and phase fluctuations of the sound wave but also its scattering have to be taken into account in the mathematical modeling of the random wave propagation.

A Linear Programming-Based Reinforcement Learning Mechanism for Incomplete-Information Games,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,"Dear Editor, Recently, with the development of artificial intelligence, game intelligence decision-making has attracted more and more attention. In particular, incomplete-information games (IIG) have gradually become a new research focus, where players make decisions without sufficient information, such as the opponent's strategies or preferences. In this case, a selfish player can only make reactive decisions based on the changes in environment and state. Thus, blind decisions by players may drift them away from the path of reward maximization, and may even hinder the health of the IIG environment. Therefore, it is necessary to design an effective mechanism to optimize decision-making for IIG players.","23299266, 23299274",14.585

Toward Zero-Determinant Strategies for Optimal Decision Making in Crowdsourcing Systems,Mathematics,"The crowdsourcing system is an internet-based distributed problem-solving and production organization model, which has been applied in human–computer interaction, databases, natural language processing, machine learning and other fields.

However, rational and selfish workers in crowdsourcing systems will submit solutions of different qualities in order to maximize their own benefits. Therefore, how to choose optimal strategies for selfish workers to maximize their benefits is important and crucial in such a scenario. In this paper, we propose a decision optimization method with incomplete information in a crowdsourcing system based on zero-determinant (ZD) strategies to help workers make optimal decisions. We first formulate the crowdsourcing problem, where workers have “winner-takes-all” rules as an iterated game with incomplete information. Subsequently, we analyze the optimal decision of workers in crowdsourcing systems in terms of ZD strategies, for which we find conditions to reach the maximum payoff of a focused worker. In addition, the analysis helps understand what solutions selfish workers will submit under the condition of having incomplete information.

Distributed control and estimation of networked agent systems,Mathematical problems in engineering,"This special issue focuses on distributed control and estimation of networked agent systems. It is well known that, nowadays, most of the real-world large-scale systems can be modeled as networked agent systems, where examples include biological systems, multivehicle systems, and distributed sensor systems. Within this context, centralized control laws or estimation algorithms may be no longer valid since the size of such a networked agent system can be huge. Furthermore, each individual agent in such a networked system may have limited computational and sensing abilities; thus, distributed control and estimation design become necessary but challenging.

HORI: a web server to compute Higher Order Residue Interactions in protein structures,BMC bioinformatics,"Background
Folding of a protein into its three dimensional structure is influenced by both local and global interactions within a protein. Higher order residue interactions, like pairwise, triplet and quadruplet ones, play a vital role in attaining the stable conformation of the protein structure.

FILIPPOV TYPE PREY–PREDATOR SYSTEM FOR SELECTIVE HARVESTING OF PREY,Journal of Biological Systems,"In this paper, the dynamics of a Filippov system with logistically growing prey and Holling Type II predation is explored. The selective nonlinear harvesting of prey is carried out when the ratio of prey to predator is above a specified threshold value. In order to prevent the extinction of both the species and sustainable economic gains, no harvesting is allowed when the ratio is below a threshold value. The equilibrium states and their stability for the individual smooth are analyzed. Filippov convex method is applied to determine the dynamics on the boundary. The sliding mode dynamics is scrutinized, and it is observed that there is no escaping region. The existence of boundary points, tangent points and pseudo-equilibrium points are established.

Mathematical scrutiny of singular predator-prey model with stage-structure of prey,Acta Applicandae Mathematicae,"In this paper, a stage structured predator-prey model with Holling type II functional response is formulated, considering the juvenile prey as the favorite food for the generalist predator. Further, the existence of predators is ensured by the sufficient amount of alternative food available in the habitat. The proportional harvesting of the adult prey is incorporated with the assumption that only the adult prey are of economic worth. The existence and local stability of the distinct equilibrium points of the system are investigated. The bifurcation from origin to predator free equilibrium state is obtained for the bifurcation parameter-effort on harvesting.

Complex dynamics of a four-species food-web model: An analysis through Beddington-DeAngelis functional response in the presence of additional food,Computational and Mathematical Biophysics,"The four-dimensional food-web system consisting of two prey species for a generalist middle predator and a top predator is proposed and investigated. The middle predator is predating over both the prey species with a modified Holling type-II functional response. The food-web model is effectively formulated, exhibits bounded behavior, and displays dissipative dynamics. The proposed model’s essential dynamical features are studied regarding local stability. We investigated the four species’ survival and established their persistence criteria. In the proposed model, a transcritical bifurcation occurs at the axial equilibrium point. The numerical simulations reveal the persistence of a chaotic attractor or stable focus. The conclusion is that increasing the food available to the middle predator may make it possible to manage and mitigate the chaos within the food chain.",25447297,1.333

Logistic growth of prey and Holling type II predation is considered. Selective proportional harvesting of predators is included. Refuge is provided to a fraction of preys when their density is below a threshold value. This reduces the food availability for predators. To compensate this, additional food is provided to predators. The dynamics on the boundary is computed using the Filippov regularization method. The stability and existence of different equilibrium states of the independent smooth subsystems are analyzed.

Systems Biology: To Meet Challenges for Biology in the Twenty-first Century,Research in Biotechnology,"Genomics, structural biology, and bioinformatics deal with identification, cataloguing and characterization of the components that make up a cell. The focus on individual genes and proteins, which has proven so powerful for the molecular genetics in the past century, is in itself inadequate to describe the dynamic processes involving interactions among tens, hundreds and even thousands of components. Cell function, including growth, differentiation, division, and apoptosis, are temporal processes and we will only be able to understand them if we treat them as dynamic systems. There is a general agreement that systems approach is necessary to understand the causal and functional relationships that generate the dynamics of biological networks and pathways.
Reductionism, which has dominated last century biological research in molecular biology, has provided a wealth of knowledge about the components of the cell to describe its structural organization and their functions. Despite its enormous success, it is increasingly clear that a discrete biological function can only rarely be attributed to an individual molecule. Instead, most biological characteristics arise from complex interactions between the cell’s numerous constituents, such as proteins, DNA, RNA and small molecules. Therefore, a key challenge for biology in the twentyfirst century is to understand the structure and the dynamics of the complex intercellular web of interactions that contribute to the structure and function of a living cell (Sontag., 2005; Mesarovic and Sreenath., 2006; Wolkenhauer., 2003).

Polynomialized model for critical DO deficit.,Journal of Environmental Science & Engineering,"The existing DO sag models of Streater-Phelps have become obsolete in the present day context of polluted streams in which a part of the BOD removal necessarily takes place through sedimentation.

Bhargava's theoretically derived model for the critical DO deficit rests on an almost linear removal of the settleable BOD and an exponential decay of non-settleable BOD. However, the Bhargava's model has two independent but complex expressions, one each for times less than and greater than the transition time. A polynomialized form of Bhargava's models for critical DO deficit has been developed as a single expression and universally applicable without any regard to the transition time.

Specifically, noisy periodic signals correspond to random networks, and chaotic time series generate networks that exhibit small world and scale free features. We show that this distinction in topological structure results from the hierarchy of unstable periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic attractor. Standard measures of structure in complex networks can therefore be applied to distinguish different dynamic regimes in time series.

Dynamic versus static biomarkers in cancer immune checkpoint blockade: unravelling complexity,Nature Reviews Drug Discovery,"Recently, there has been a coordinated effort from academic institutions and the pharmaceutical industry to identify biomarkers that can predict responses to immune checkpoint blockade in cancer. Several biomarkers have been identified; however, none has reliably predicted response in a sufficiently rigorous manner for routine use. Here, we argue that the therapeutic response to immune checkpoint blockade is a critical state transition of a complex system. Such systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions, and critical transitions are notoriously difficult to predict far in advance. Nevertheless, warning signals can be detected closer to the tipping point. Advances in mathematics and network biology are starting to make it possible to identify such warning signals.

Hub nodes inhibit the outbreak of epidemic under voluntary vaccination,New Journal of Physics,"It is commonly believed that epidemic spreading on scale-free networks is difficult to control and that the disease can spread even with a low infection rate, lacking an epidemic threshold. In this paper, we study epidemic spreading on complex networks under the framework of game theory, in which a voluntary vaccination strategy is incorporated. In particular, individuals face the'dilemma'of vaccination: they have to decide whether or not to vaccinate according to the trade-off between the risk and the side effects or cost of vaccination. Remarkably and quite excitingly, we find that disease outbreak can be more effectively inhibited on scale-free networks than on random networks. This is because the hub nodes of scale-free networks are more inclined to take self-vaccination after balancing the pros and cons. This result is encouraging as it indicates that real-world networks, which are often claimed to be scale free, can …",13672630,2.844

Small world and scale free model of transmission of SARS,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,We model transmission of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in Hong Kong with a complex small world network. Each node in the network is connected to its immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically isolated nodes. Transmission can only occur along these links. We find that this model exhibits dynamics very similar to those observed during the SARS outbreak in 2003. We derive an analytic expression for the rate of infection and confirm this expression with computational simulations. An immediate consequence of this quantity is that the severity of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003 was due to ineffectual infection control in hospitals (i.e. nosocomial transmission). If all infectious individuals were isolated as rapidly as they were identified the severity of the outbreak would have been minimal.,"02181274, 17936551",2.088
Optimal embedding parameters: a modelling paradigm,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"The reconstruction of a dynamical system from a time series requires the selection of two parameters: the embedding dimension de and the embedding lag τ. Many competing criteria to select these parameters exist, and all are heuristic. Within the context of modelling the evolution operator of the underlying dynamical system, we show that one only need be concerned with the product deτ. We introduce an information theoretic criterion for the optimal selection of the embedding window dw=deτ. For infinitely long time series, this method is equivalent to selecting the embedding lag that minimises the nonlinear model prediction error. For short and noisy time series, we find that the results of this new algorithm are data-dependent and are superior to estimation of embedding parameters with the standard techniques.",01672789,3.117

Communities within this network are connected with a distribution of links with infinite variance. Hence, the disease transmission model does not exhibit a threshold and so the infection will continue to propagate even with very low transmissibility.

Synchronization of chaotic systems and their machine-learning models,Physical Review E,"Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of a machine-learning approach known as “reservoir computing” for model-free prediction of chaotic systems. We find that a well-trained reservoir computer can synchronize with its learned chaotic systems by linking them with a common signal. A necessary condition for achieving this synchronization is the negative values of the sub-Lyapunov exponents. Remarkably, we show that by sending just a scalar signal, one can achieve synchronism in trained reservoir computers and a cascading synchronization among chaotic systems and their fitted reservoir computers. Moreover, we demonstrate that this synchronization is maintained even in the presence of a parameter mismatch. Our findings possibly provide a path for accurate production of all expected signals in unknown chaotic systems using just one observational measure.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Is breathing in infants chaotic?

Correlation dimension can be used to quantify the complexity of time series and has been applied to a variety of physiological and biological measurements. However, the methods most commonly used to estimate correlation dimension suffer from some technical problems that can produce misleading results if not correctly applied.

From this model, we derive an expression for the probability of a widespread outbreak and a condition to ensure that the epidemic is controlled. Moreover, multiple simulations are used to make predictions of the likelihood of various eventual scenarios for fixed initial conditions.

Applying the method of surrogate data to cyclic time series,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"The surrogate data methodology is used to test a given time series for membership of specific classes of dynamical systems. Currently, there are three algorithms that are widely applied in the literature. The most general of these tests the hypothesis of nonlinearly scaled linearly filtered noise. However, these tests and the many extensions of them that have been suggested are inappropriate for data exhibiting strong cyclic components. For such data it is more natural to ask if there exist any long term (of period longer than the data cycle length) determinism. In this paper we discuss existing techniques that attempt to address this hypothesis and introduce a new approach. This new approach generates surrogates that are constrained (i.e., they look like the data) and for cyclic time series tests the null hypothesis of a periodic orbit with uncorrelated noise.

Minimum description length neural networks for time series prediction,Physical Review E,"Artificial neural networks (ANN) are typically composed of a large number of nonlinear functions (neurons) each with several linear and nonlinear parameters that are fitted to data through a computationally intensive training process. Longer training results in a closer fit to the data, but excessive training will lead to overfitting. We propose an alternative scheme that has previously been described for radial basis functions (RBF). We show that fundamental differences between ANN and RBF make application of this scheme to ANN nontrivial. Under this scheme, the training process is replaced by an optimal fitting routine, and overfitting is avoided by controlling the number of neurons in the network. We show that for time series modeling and prediction, this procedure leads to small models (few neurons) that mimic the underlying dynamics of the system well and do not overfit the data.

This approach yields weighted directed networks representing the pattern transition properties of time series in velocity space, which hence provides dynamic insights of the underling system. Furthermore, we propose a measure of entropy to characterize ordinal partition transition dynamics, which is sensitive to capturing the possible local geometric changes of phase space trajectories.

Clustering model for transmission of the SARS virus: application to epidemic control and risk assessment,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"We propose a new four state model for disease transmission and illustrate the model with data from the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. The critical feature of this model is that the community is modelled as a small-world network of interconnected nodes. Each node is linked to a fixed number of immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically remote nodes. Transmission can only propagate between linked nodes. This model exhibits two features typical of SARS transmission: geographically localized outbreaks and “super-spreaders”. Neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible-infected-removed models of disease transmission. Our analysis indicates that “super-spreaders” may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant. Moreover, we find that nosocomial transmission in Hong Kong directly contributed to the severity of the outbreak and that by limiting …",03784371,3.098
Subspace based network community detection using sparse linear coding,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,"Information mining from networks by identifying communities is an important problem across a number of research fields including social science, biology, physics, and medicine. Most existing community detection algorithms are graph theoretic and lack the ability to detect accurate community boundaries if the ratio of intra-community to inter-community links is low. Also, algorithms based on modularity maximization may fail to resolve communities smaller than a specific size if the community size varies significantly. In this paper, we present a fundamentally different community detection algorithm based on the fact that each network community spans a different subspace in the geodesic space. Therefore, each node can only be efficiently represented as a linear combination of nodes spanning the same subspace. To make the process of community detection more robust, we use sparse linear coding with norm …",10414347,8.474
Flocking of multi-agent dynamical systems based on pseudo-leader mechanism,Systems & Control Letters,"Flocking behavior of multiple agents can be widely observed in nature such as schooling fish and flocking birds. Recent literature has proposed the possibility that flocking can be achieved even with only a small fraction of informed agents with the desired position and velocity. However, it is still a challenging problem to determine which agents should be informed or have the ability to detect the desired information. This paper aims to address this problem. By combining the ideas of virtual force and pseudo-leader mechanism, where a pseudo-leader represents an informed agent who can detect the desired information, we propose a scheme for choosing pseudo-leaders in a multi-agent group, which can be applied to an unconnected or switching neighbor graph. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the methods presented in this paper.",01676911,2.53
Multiscale ordinal network analysis of human cardiac dynamics,"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","In this study, we propose a new information theoretic measure to quantify the complexity of biological systems based on time-series data. We demonstrate the potential of our method using two distinct applications to human cardiac dynamics. Firstly, we show that the method clearly discriminates between segments of electrocardiogram records characterized by normal sinus rhythm, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Secondly, we investigate the multiscale complexity of cardiac dynamics with respect to age in healthy individuals using interbeat interval time series and compare our findings with a previous study which established a link between age and fractal-like long-range correlations. The method we use is an extension of the symbolic mapping procedure originally proposed for permutation entropy.

Uncovering non-linear structure in human ECG recordings,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","We employ surrogate data techniques and a new correlation dimension estimation algorithm, the Gaussian kernel algorithm, to uncover non-linearity in human electrocardiogram recordings during normal (sinus) rhythm, ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). We conclude that all three rhythms are not linear (i.e. distinct from a monotonic non-linear transformation of linearly filtered noise) and have significant correlations over a period greater than the inter-beat interval. Furthermore, we observe that sinus rhythm and VT exhibit a correlation dimension of approximately 2.3 and 2.4, respectively. The correlation dimension of VF exceeds 3.2. The entropy of sinus rhythm, VT and VF is approximately 0.69, 0.55, and 0.67 nats/s, respectively. These results indicate that techniques from non-linear dynamical systems theory should help us understand the mechanism underlying ventricular arrhythmia, and …",09600779,5.969
Towards long-term prediction,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"This paper describes a simple method of obtaining longer-term predictions from a nonlinear time-series, assuming one already has a reasonably good short-term predictor. The usefulness of the technique is that it eliminates, to some extent, the systematic errors of the iterated short-term predictor. The technique we describe also provides an indication of the prediction horizon. We consider systems with both observational and dynamic noise and analyse a number of artificial and experimental systems obtaining consistent results. We also compare this method of longer-term prediction with ensemble prediction.",01672789,3.117
Preferential imitation can invalidate targeted subsidy policies on seasonal-influenza diseases,Applied Mathematics and Computation,"In this paper, under the complex network framework, we study a seasonal influenza-like disease model by incorporating the interplay between subsidy policies and human behavioral responses. In the model a small proportion of individuals are freely vaccinated according to either the targeted or random subsidy policy in advance, while the remaining individuals choose to vaccinate (or not) based on voluntary principle and update their vaccination decision via an imitation rule. Our findings show that the targeted subsidy policy is only advantageous when individuals prefer to imitate the subsidized individuals’ strategy. Otherwise, the effectiveness of the targeted policy is worse than that of the random subsidy policy, since individuals preferentially select non-subsidized individuals as their potential imitation objects. More importantly, under the targeted subsidy policy, preferential imitation causes a non-trivial …","00963003, 18735649",3.991
Comparisons of new nonlinear modeling techniques with applications to infant respiration,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"This paper concerns the application of new nonlinear time-series modeling methods to recordings of infant respiratory patterns. The techniques used combine the concept of minimum description length modeling with radial basis models. Our first application of the methods produced results that were not entirely satisfactory, particularly with respect to accurately modeling long term quantitative and qualitative features of respiration patterns. This paper describes a number of modifications of the original methods and makes a comparison of the improvements the various modifications gave. The modifications made were increasing the class of basis function, broadening the range of possible embedding strategies, improving the optimization of the likelihood of the model parameters and calculating a closer approximation to description length. The criteria used in the comparisons were description length, root-mean …",01672789,3.117
Correlation dimension: A pivotal statistic for non-constrained realizations of composite hypotheses in surrogate data analysis,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Currently surrogate data analysis can be used to determine if data is consistent with various linear systems, or something else (a nonlinear system). In this paper we propose an extension of these methods in an attempt to make more specific classifications within the class of nonlinear systems. In the method of surrogate data one estimates the probability distribution of values of a test statistic for a set of experimental data under the assumption that the data is consistent with a given hypothesis. If the probability distribution of the test statistic is different for different dynamical systems consistent with the hypothesis, one must ensure that the surrogate generation technique generates surrogate data that are a good approximation to the data. This is often achieved with a careful choice of surrogate generation method and for noise driven linear surrogates such methods are commonly used. This paper argues that, in many …",01672789,3.117
Modelling strong control measures for epidemic propagation with networks—A COVID-19 case study,IEEE access,"We show that precise knowledge of epidemic transmission parameters is not required to build an informative model of the spread of disease. We propose a detailed model of the topology of the contact network under various external control regimes and demonstrate that this is sufficient to capture the salient dynamical characteristics and to inform decisions. Contact between individuals in the community is characterised by a contact graph, the structure of that contact graph is selected to mimic community control measures. Our model of city-level transmission of an infectious agent (SEIR model) characterises spread via a (a) scale-free contact network (no control); (b) a random graph (elimination of mass gatherings); and (c) small world lattice (partial to full lockdown-“social” distancing).

Seeding the kernels in graphs: Toward multi-resolution community analysis,New Journal of Physics,"Current endeavors in community detection suffer from the resolution limit problem and can be quite expensive for large networks, especially those based on optimization schemes. We propose a conceptually different approach for multi-resolution community detection, by introducing the kernels from statistical literature into the graph, which mimic the node interaction that decays locally with the geodesic distance. The modular structure naturally arises as the patterns inherent in the interaction landscape, which can be easily identified by the hill climbing process. The range of node interaction, and henceforth the resolution of community detection, is controlled via tuning the kernel bandwidth in a systematic way. Our approach is computationally efficient and its effectiveness is demonstrated using both synthetic and real networks with multiscale structures.",13672630,2.844
A novel control strategy of DFIG wind turbines in complex power systems for enhancement of primary frequency response and LFOD,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,"In this paper, we propose a novel control strategy for doubly fed wind turbine generators (DFWTG) in complex power systems to improve the primary frequency response and enhance low-frequency oscillation (LFO) damping of power systems. The main innovation in the new control scheme dwells in the novel control schemes for rotor side controller (RSC) of DFWTG. Weighted frequency deviations of local synchronous generator (SG) bus bars are utilized as input signals to a dedicated power system stabilizer, specifically designed for the RSC of DFWTG, with parameters optimized by particle swarm optimization. The newly devised RSC with conventional DFWTG control structure is capable of ameliorating primary frequency response of the power system. To eliminate the area control error, a secondary control scheme is incorporated, which makes use of the spinning reserve of selected SGs through automatic …",08858950,7.894
Long-term changes in the north–south asymmetry of solar activity: a nonlinear dynamics characterization using visibility graphs,Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics,"Solar activity is characterized by complex dynamics superimposed onto an almost periodic, approximately 11-year cycle. One of its main features is the presence of a marked, time-varying hemispheric asymmetry, the deeper reasons for which have not yet been completely uncovered. Traditionally, this asymmetry has been studied by considering amplitude and phase differences. Here, we use visibility graphs, a novel tool of nonlinear time series analysis, to obtain complementary information on hemispheric asymmetries in dynamical properties. Our analysis provides deep insights into the potential and limitations of this method, revealing a complex interplay between factors relating to statistical and dynamical properties, i.e., effects due to the probability distribution and the regularity of observed fluctuations. We demonstrate that temporal changes in the hemispheric predominance of the graph properties lag those directly associated with the total hemispheric sunspot areas. Our findings open a new dynamical perspective on studying the north–south sunspot asymmetry, which is to be further explored in future work.","10235809, 16077946",1.724
Time series analysis of the developed financial markets’ integration using visibility graphs,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"A time series representing the developed financial markets’ segmentation from 1973 to 2012 is studied. The time series reveals an obvious market integration trend. To further uncover the features of this time series, we divide it into seven windows and generate seven visibility graphs. The measuring capabilities of the visibility graphs provide means to quantitatively analyze the original time series. It is found that the important historical incidents that influenced market integration coincide with variations in the measured graphical node degree. Through the measure of neighborhood span, the frequencies of the historical incidents are disclosed. Moreover, it is also found that large “cycles” and significant noise in the time series are linked to large and small communities in the generated visibility graphs. For large cycles, how historical incidents significantly affected market integration is distinguished by density and …",03784371,3.098
Complex network approach to characterize the statistical features of the sunspot series,New Journal of Physics,"Complex network approaches have been recently developed as an alternative framework to study the statistical features of time-series data. We perform a visibility-graph analysis on both the daily and monthly sunspot series. Based on the data, we propose two ways to construct the network: one is from the original observable measurements and the other is from a negative-inverse-transformed series. The degree distribution of the derived networks for the strong maxima has clear non-Gaussian properties, while the degree distribution for minima is bimodal. The long-term variation of the cycles is reflected by hubs in the network that span relatively large time intervals. Based on standard network structural measures, we propose to characterize the long-term correlations by waiting times between two subsequent events. The persistence range of the solar cycles has been identified over 15–1000 days by a power-law …",13672630,2.844

Surrogate data methods show that simple random models are insufficient and that the standard epidemic susceptible-infected-removed model does not fully account for the underlying variability in the observed data. As an alternative, we consider a more complex small world network model and show that such a structure can be applied to reliably produce simulations quantitative similar to the true data.

The use of the perimeter-area method to calculate the fractal dimension of aggregates,Powder technology,"Complicated geometrical objects like aggregate clusters can be characterised by a simple parameter: the fractal dimension. There are many ways to measure this fractal dimension. For most methods, it is found by the exponent of a relationship between an intrinsic value, such as mass or area, to a characteristic value, such as bulk aggregate length. The perimeter-area method was derived by Mandelbrot to measure the fractal dimension of chips of ore. In this method, there is no distinction of whether the perimeter and area values are characteristic or intrinsic.
Various methods of measuring the fractal dimension are used on different known fractal objects to demonstrate these issues in an idealised setting.
We show that while the distinction is not important for Mandelbrot's ore chips, which are island-type objects, it is very important in the analysis of cluster-type objects. The perimeter-area method is a valid tool in the …","00325910, 1873328X",4.901
Epidemic outbreaks on networks with effective contacts,Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications,"In real-world networks of disease transmission, the incidence of infection among individuals conforms to a certain fixed probability of effective contact between them, which must meet some necessary conditions for the disease to continue to spread. Based on susceptible/infective/removed (SIR) models in homogeneous or heterogeneous networks, we find that these models evolve dynamically just like in networks without connectivity fluctuations if all the susceptible individuals are supposed to have the same effective contact. This means that effectively heterogeneous contacts play a striking role in epidemic dynamics. To go a step further, we introduce the effective contact function (ECF) into models and present an analytical and numerical study for the threshold and dynamical behaviors of epidemic incidence. The power-law and proportional ECFs are considered, and, we demonstrate analytically that the epidemic …",14681218,2.179
Comparing classical and quantum PageRanks,Quantum information processing,"Following recent developments in quantum PageRanking, we present a comparative analysis of discrete-time and continuous-time quantum-walk-based PageRank algorithms. Relative to classical PageRank and to different extents, the quantum measures better highlight secondary hubs and resolve ranking degeneracy among peripheral nodes for all networks we studied in this paper. For the discrete-time case, we investigated the periodic nature of the walker’s probability distribution for a wide range of networks and found that the dominant period does not grow with the size of these networks. Based on this observation, we introduce a new quantum measure using the maximum probabilities of the associated walker during the first couple of periods. This is particularly important, since it leads to a quantum PageRanking scheme that is scalable with respect to network size.",15700755,2.457
Superinfection behaviors on scale-free networks with competing strains,Journal of nonlinear science,"This paper considers the epidemiology of two strains (I,J) of a disease spreading through a population represented by a scale-free network. The epidemiological model is SIS and the two strains have different reproductive numbers. Superinfection means that strain I can infect individuals already infected with strain J, replacing the strain J infection. Individuals infected with strain I cannot be infected with strain J. The model is set up as a system of ordering differential equations and stability of the disease free, marginal strain I and strain J, and coexistence equilibria are assessed using linear stability analysis, supported by simulations. The main conclusion is that superinfection, as modeled in this paper, can allow strain I to coexist with strain J even when it has a lower basic reproductive number. Most strikingly, it can allow strain I to persist even when its reproductive number is less than 1.","09388974, 14321467",2.5
Identifying the topology of a coupled FitzHugh–Nagumo neurobiological network via a pinning mechanism,IEEE transactions on neural networks,"Topology identification of a network has received great interest for the reason that the study on many key properties of a network assumes a special known topology. Different from recent similar works in which the evolution of all the nodes in a complex network need to be received, this brief presents a novel criterion to identify the topology of a coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurobiological network by receiving the membrane potentials of only a fraction of the neurons. Meanwhile, although incomplete information is received, the evolution of all the neurons including membrane potentials and recovery variables are traced. Based on Schur complement and Lyapunov stability theory, the exact weight configuration matrix can be estimated by a simple adaptive feedback control. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is successfully verified by neural networks with fixed and switching topologies.","2162237X, 21622388",11.831
Determinism in financial time series,Studies in nonlinear dynamics & Econometrics,"The attractive possibility that financial indices may be chaotic has been the subject of much study. In this paper we address two specific questions: ""Masked by stochasticity, do financial data exhibit deterministic nonlinearity?"", and ""If so, so what?"". We examine daily returns from three financial indicators: the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the London gold fixings, and the USD-JPY exchange rate. For each data set we apply surrogate data methods and nonlinearity tests to quantify determinism over a wide range of time scales (from 100 to 20,000 days). We find that all three time series are distinct from linear noise or conditional heteroskedastic models and that there therefore exists detectable deterministic nonlinearity that can potentially be exploited for prediction.","10811826, 15583708",0.797

Frequency deviations of generators of interest are employed as the input signals of the designed supplementary damping controller of STATCOM. In order to obtain the optimal load-oriented control parameters, a day-ahead load-forecasting scheme is devised, using artificial neural network (ANN) learning techniques. The ANN is trained by a set of data over a 4-year period, and then the control parameters are optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization technique by minimizing the critical damping index.

Detecting nonlinearity in experimental data,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,The technique of surrogate data has been used as a method to test for membership of particular classes of linear systems. We suggest an obvious extension of this to classes of nonlinear parametric models and demonstrate our methods with respiratory data from sleeping human infants. Although our data are clearly distinct from the different classes of linear systems we are unable to distinguish between our data and surrogates generated by nonlinear models. Hence we conclude that human respiration is likely to be a nonlinear system with more than two degrees of freedom with a limit cycle that is driven by high dimensional dynamics or noise.,"02181274, 17936551",2.088
Link direction for link prediction,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"Almost all previous studies on link prediction have focused on using the properties of the network to predict the existence of links between pairs of nodes. Unfortunately, previous methods rarely consider the role of link direction for link prediction. In fact, many real-world complex networks are directed and ignoring the link direction will mean overlooking important information. In this study, we propose a phase-dynamic algorithm of the directed network nodes to analyse the role of link directions and demonstrate that the bi-directional links and the one-directional links have different roles in link prediction and network structure formation. From this, we propose new directional prediction methods and use six real networks to test our algorithms. In real networks, we find that compared to a pair of nodes which are connected by a one-directional link, a pair of nodes which are connected by a bi-directional link always have …",03784371,3.098

Tests of the random walk hypothesis for financial data,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"We propose a method from the viewpoint of deterministic dynamical systems to investigate whether observed data follow a random walk (RW) and apply the method to several financial data. Our method is based on the previously proposed small-shuffle surrogate method. Hence, our method does not depend on the specific data distribution, although previously proposed methods depend on properties of the data distribution. The data we use are stock market (Standard & Poor's 500 in US market and Nikkei225 in Japanese market), exchange rate (British Pound/US dollar and Japanese Yen/US dollar), and commodity market (gold price and crude oil price).

Modeling the influence of information on the coevolution of contact networks and the dynamics of infectious diseases,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Outbreaks of infectious diseases may awaken the awareness of individuals, consequently, they may adjust their contact patterns according to the perceived risk from disease. In this paper, we assume that individuals make decisions on breaking or recovering links according to the information of diseases spreading which they have acquired. They will reduce some links when diseases are prevalent and have high risks; otherwise, they will recover some original links when the diseases are controlled or present minimal risk. Under such an assumption, we study the effects of information of diseases on the contact patterns within the population and on the dynamics of epidemics. By extensive simulations and theoretical analysis, we find that, due to the time-delayed information of diseases, both the density of the disease and the topology of the network vary with time in a periodic form.

Here we introduce a novel framework for social communication by reshaping the networked system to be a simplicial complex, where the communication involves the interaction not only of individual nodes but also among cliques to which they belong. Simplicial complexes extend the network-based pairwise relationship to multiagent interaction. Assuming that the same individual in different cliques may play different roles, a threshold is designed and combined with the node state to determine the clique state.

The role of direct links for link prediction in evolving networks,Europhysics Letters,"Link prediction is the problem of predicting the existence and location of unknown links from uncertain structural information of a network. Most existing accuracy measures do not consider the role of time evolution within the network. Moreover, almost all existing methods use indirect links to infer and evaluate the validity of links. We introduce time as a parameter for link prediction accuracy measures, and we modify the structure of the link prediction algorithms to exploit information of the known direct links for link prediction. We find that the direct link algorithm performs better than the indirect link algorithm for a range of time varying networks. We show that the network structure plays a more important role than weights for links prediction. In addition, our analysis finds that the number of common neighbours also plays an important role for the so-called weak-ties phenomenon.","02955075, 12864854",1.8
Prevention of infectious diseases by public vaccination and individual protection,Journal of mathematical biology,"In the face of serious infectious diseases, governments endeavour to implement containment measures such as public vaccination at a macroscopic level. Meanwhile, individuals tend to protect themselves by avoiding contacts with infections at a microscopic level.

We study a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model with imperfect vaccination on dynamic contact networks, where the macroscopic intervention is represented by random vaccination of the population and the microscopic protection is characterised by susceptible individuals rewiring contacts from infective neighbours. In particular, the model is formulated both in populations without and then with demographic effects (births, deaths, and migration).

Preferential attachment is one of many algorithms that have been introduced to model the growth and structure of scale-free networks. With so many different models of scale-free networks it is unclear what properties of scale-free networks are typical, and what properties are peculiarities of a particular growth or construction process. We propose a simple maximum entropy process which provides the best representation of what are typical properties of scale-free networks, and provides a standard against which real and algorithmically generated networks can be compared. As an example we consider preferential attachment and find that this particular growth model does not yield typical realizations of scale-free networks.

In particular, assortative networks are transformed into time series with long-range correlation, while disassortative networks are transformed into time series exhibiting anticorrelation. These relationships are consistent across a diverse variety of real networks. Moreover, we show that multiscale analysis of these time series can describe and classify various physical networks ranging from social and technological to biological networks according to their functional origin.

In this paper, we consider the problem of model selection and investigate the performance of a number of proposed information criteria and whether the assumption to obtain the formulae that fitting errors are normally distributed hold or not in some conditions (different data points and noise levels). The results show that although the application of information criteria prevents over-fitting and under-fitting in most cases, there are cases where we cannot avoid even involving many data points and low noise levels in ideal situations. The results also show that the distribution of the fitting errors is not always normally distributed, although the observational noise is Gaussian, which contradicts an assumption of the information criteria.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Risk estimation of infectious diseases determines the effectiveness of the control strategy,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,"Usually, whether to take vaccination or not is a voluntary decision, which is determined by many factors, from societal factors (such as religious belief and human rights) to individual preferences (including psychology and altruism). Facing the outbreaks of infectious diseases, different people often have different estimations on the risk of infectious diseases. So, some persons are willing to vaccinate, but other persons are willing to take risks. In this paper, we establish two different risk assessment systems using the technique of dynamic programming, and then compare the effects of the two different systems on the prevention of diseases on complex networks. One is that the perceived probability of being infected for each individual is the same (uniform case). The other is that the perceived probability of being infected is positively correlated to individual degrees (preferential case). We show that these two risk …",01672789,3.117
Rhythmic dynamics and synchronization via dimensionality reduction: application to human gait,PLoS computational biology,"Reliable characterization of locomotor dynamics of human walking is vital to understanding the neuromuscular control of human locomotion and disease diagnosis. However, the inherent oscillation and ubiquity of noise in such non-strictly periodic signals pose great challenges to current methodologies. To this end, we exploit the state-of-the-art technology in pattern recognition and, specifically, dimensionality reduction techniques, and propose to reconstruct and characterize the dynamics accurately on the cycle scale of the signal. This is achieved by deriving a low-dimensional representation of the cycles through global optimization, which effectively preserves the topology of the cycles that are embedded in a high-dimensional Euclidian space. Our approach demonstrates a clear advantage in capturing the intrinsic dynamics and probing the subtle synchronization patterns from uni/bivariate oscillatory signals over traditional methods. Application to human gait data for healthy subjects and diabetics reveals a significant difference in the dynamics of ankle movements and ankle-knee coordination, but not in knee movements. These results indicate that the impaired sensory feedback from the feet due to diabetes does not influence the knee movement in general, and that normal human walking is not critically dependent on the feedback from the peripheral nervous system.","1553734X, 15537358",3.65

This technique is based on an information theoretic reduction of linear (autoregressive) models so that only the essential features of an autoregressive model are retained. These models we call reduced autoregressive models (RARM). The essential features of reduced autoregressive models include any periodicity present in the data. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence from both experimental and artificial data to demonstrate that this technique will reliably detect periodicities if and only if they are present in the data.

Using geodesic space density gradients for network community detection,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,"Many real world complex systems naturally map to network data structures instead of geometric spaces because the only available information is the presence or absence of a link between two entities in the system. To enable data mining techniques to solve problems in the network domain, the nodes need to be mapped to a geometric space. We propose this mapping by representing each network node with its geodesic distances from all other nodes. The space spanned by the geodesic distance vectors is the geodesic space of that network. The position of different nodes in the geodesic space encode the network structure. In this space, considering a continuous density field induced by each node, density at a specific point is the summation of density fields induced by all nodes. We drift each node in the direction of positive density gradient using an iterative algorithm till each node reaches a local maximum. Due …",10414347,8.474

Adaptive cluster synchronization in networks with time-varying and distributed coupling delays,Applied Mathematical Modelling,"This paper studies the adaptive cluster synchronization of a generalized linearly coupled network with time-varying delay and distributed delays. This network includes nonidentical nodes displaying different local dynamical behaviors, while for each cluster of that network the internal dynamics is uniform (such as chaotic, periodic, or stable behavior). In particular, the generalized coupling matrix of this network can be asymmetric and weighted. Two different adaptive laws of time-varying coupling strength and a linear feedback control are designed to achieve the cluster synchronization of this network. Some sufficient conditions to ensure the cluster synchronization are obtained by using the invariant principle of functional differential equations and linear matrix inequality (LMI).

Generation of clusters in complex dynamical networks via pinning control,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,"Many real-world networks show community structure, ie, groups (or clusters) of nodes that have a high density of links within them but with a lower density of links between them. In this paper, by applying feedback injections to a fraction of network nodes, various clusters are synchronized independently according to the community structure generated by the group partition of the network (cluster synchronization). This control is achieved by pinning (ie applying linear feedback control) to a subset of the network nodes. Those pinned nodes are selected not randomly but according to the topological structure of communities of a given network. Specifically, for a given group partition of a network, those nodes with direct connections between groups must be pinned in order to achieve cluster synchronization. Both the local stability and global stability of cluster synchronization are investigated. Taking the tree-shaped …","17518113, 17518121",2.078
Dynamical modeling of collective behavior from pigeon flight data: Flock cohesion and dispersion,PLoS computational biology,"Several models of flocking have been promoted based on simulations with qualitatively naturalistic behavior. In this paper we provide the first direct application of computational modeling methods to infer flocking behavior from experimental field data. We show that this approach is able to infer general rules for interaction, or lack of interaction, among members of a flock or, more generally, any community. Using experimental field measurements of homing pigeons in flight we demonstrate the existence of a basic distance dependent attraction/repulsion relationship and show that this rule is sufficient to explain collective behavior observed in nature. Positional data of individuals over time are used as input data to a computational algorithm capable of building complex nonlinear functions that can represent the system behavior. Topological nearest neighbor interactions are considered to characterize the components within this model. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated with simulated noisy data generated from the classical (two dimensional) Vicsek model. When applied to experimental data from homing pigeon flights we show that the more complex three dimensional models are capable of simulating trajectories, as well as exhibiting realistic collective dynamics. The simulations of the reconstructed models are used to extract properties of the collective behavior in pigeons, and how it is affected by changing the initial conditions of the system. Our results demonstrate that this approach may be applied to construct models capable of simulating trajectories and collective dynamics using experimental field measurements of herd movement …","1553734X, 15537358",3.65
Evidence consistent with deterministic chaos in human cardiac data: surrogate and nonlinear dynamical modeling,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Whether or not the human cardiac system is chaotic has long been a subject of interest in the application of nonlinear time series analysis. The surrogate data method, which identifies an observed time series against three common kinds of hypotheses, does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm the existence of deterministic chaotic dynamics in cardiac time series, such as electrocardiogram data and pulse pressure propagation data. Moreover, these methods fail to exclude all but the most trivial hypothesis of linear noise. We present a recently suggested fourth algorithm for testing the hypotheses of a noise driven periodic orbit to decide whether these signals are consistent with deterministic chaos. Of course, we cannot exclude all other alternatives but our test is certainly stronger than the those applied previously. The algorithmic complexity is used as the discriminating statistic of the surrogate data method. We …","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Modeling continuous processes from data,Physical Review E,"Experimental and simulated time series are necessarily discretized in time. However, many real and artificial systems are more naturally modeled as continuous-time systems. This paper reviews the major techniques employed to estimate a continuous vector field from a finite discrete time series. We compare the performance of various methods on experimental and artificial time series and explore the connection between continuous (differential) and discrete (difference equation) systems. As part of this process we propose improvements to existing techniques. Our results demonstrate that the continuous-time dynamics of many noisy data sets can be simulated more accurately by modeling the one-step prediction map than by modeling the vector field. We also show that radial basis models provide superior results to global polynomial models.","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Lévy walk navigation in complex networks: A distinct relation between optimal transport exponent and network dimension,Scientific reports,"We investigate, for the first time, navigation on networks with a Lévy walk strategy such that the step probability scales as pij ~ dij–α, where dij is the Manhattan distance between nodes i and j and α is the transport exponent. We find that the optimal transport exponent αopt of such a diffusion process is determined by the fractal dimension df of the underlying network. Specially, we theoretically derive the relation αopt = df + 2 for synthetic networks and we demonstrate that this holds for a number of real-world networks. Interestingly, the relationship we derive is different from previous results for Kleinberg navigation without or with a cost constraint, where the optimal conditions are α = df and α = df + 1, respectively. Our results uncover another general mechanism for how network dimension can precisely govern the efficient diffusion behavior on diverse networks.",20452322,3.883
Testing time series for nonlinearity,Statistics and computing,"The technique of surrogate data analysis may be employed to test the hypothesis that an observed data set was generated by one of several specific classes of dynamical system. Current algorithms for surrogate data analysis enable one, in a generic way, to test for membership of the following three classes of dynamical system: (0) independent and identically distributed noise, (1) linearly filtered noise, and (2) a monotonic nonlinear transformation of linearly filtered noise.
We show that one may apply statistics from nonlinear dynamical systems theory, in particular those derived from the correlation integral, as test statistics for the hypothesis that an observed time series is consistent with each of these three linear classes of dynamical system. Using statistics based on the correlation integral we show that it is also possible to test much broader (and not necessarily linear) hypotheses.

We approach the interaction between the various scalar time series from a deterministic dynamical system perspective and provide a generic and algorithmic test for whether the interaction between two measured time series is statistically significant. The method can be applied even when the data exhibit no obvious qualitative similarity: a situation in which the naive method utilizing the cross correlation function directly cannot correctly identify connectivity. To establish the connectivity between nodes we apply the previously proposed small-shuffle surrogate (SSS) method, which can investigate whether there are correlation structures in short-term variabilities (irregular fluctuations) between two data sets from the viewpoint of deterministic dynamical systems.

Parameter inference in small world network disease models with approximate Bayesian computational methods,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,Small world network models have been effective in capturing the variable behaviour of reported case data of the SARS coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong during 2003. Simulations of these models have previously been realized using informed “guesses” of the proposed model parameters and tested for consistency with the reported data by surrogate analysis. In this paper we attempt to provide statistically rigorous parameter distributions using Approximate Bayesian Computation sampling methods.

Minimum description length criterion for modeling of chaotic attractors with multilayer perceptron networks,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,"Overfitting has long been recognized as a problem endemic to models with a large number of parameters. The usual method of avoiding this problem in neural networks is to avoid fitting the data too precisely, and this technique cannot determine the exact model size directly. In this paper, we describe an alternative, information theoretic criterion to determine the number of neurons in the optimal model. When applied to the time series prediction problem we find that models which minimize the description length (DL) of the data, both generalize well and accurately capture the underlying dynamics. We illustrate our method with several computational and experimental examples.",15498328,5.886
Review mechanism promotes knowledge transmission in complex networks,Applied Mathematics and Computation,"Knowledge transmission systems differ from epidemic spreading systems in that people who have forgotten knowledge can reacquire it through reviewing. In order to analyze the review mechanism, we propose a Naive-Evangelical-Agnostic (VEA) knowledge transmission model in complex networks.

Mean field theory is used to theoretically delineate the knowledge transmission systems. In homogeneous networks, the steady state solution of the system is obtained. In heterogeneous networks, we get the basic reproduction number R0, in which the reviewing rate is an important parameter. Moreover, we analyze the system and prove that if R0 < 1, the knowledge loss equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable; if R0 > 1, the knowledge is permanent.

Enhancing complex network controllability by minimum link direction reversal,Physics Letters A,"Controllability of complex networks has recently become one of the most popular research fields, but the importance of link direction for controllability has not been systematically considered. We propose a method to enhance controllability of a directed network by changing the direction of a small fraction of links while keeping the total number of links unchanged. The main idea of the method is to find candidate links based on the matching path. Extensive numerical simulation on many modeled networks demonstrates that this method is effective. Furthermore, we find that the nodes linked to candidate links have a distinct character, which provide us with a strategy to improve the controllability based on the local structure. Since the whole topology of many real networks is not visible and we only get some local structure information, this strategy is potentially more practical compared to those that demand complete …","00036951, 10773118",3.462
Adjusting learning motivation to promote cooperation,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"An evolutionary prisoner’s dilemma game with players adjusting their learning motivation is studied. At each time step, each player can adjust his/her learning motivation according to the difference between the current payoff and payoff aspiration. Greater payoff aspiration means stronger learning motivation, and vice versa. We find that the density of cooperation in a spatial prisoner’s dilemma game is enhanced when the learning motivation mechanism is considered. Meanwhile, we show that proper noise can not only induce the highest cooperation level but also can maintain the cooperation phenomenon even though there is more temptation to defect.",03784371,3.098

These algorithms require no knowledge of specific mathematical properties of the underlying map modeling the system. The existence of chaos is demonstrated using various tools including graphical iteration, histogram, Lyapunov exponent and surrogate tests.

It has been observed that different dynamics can produce networks with distinct topological characteristics under a variety of time-series-to-network transforms that have been proposed in the literature. The direct connection, however, remains unclear.

Impact of asymptomatic infection on coupled disease-behavior dynamics in complex networks,Europhysics Letters,"Studies on how to model the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses (so-called coupled disease-behavior interaction) have attracted increasing attention. Owing to the lack of obvious clinical evidence of diseases, or the incomplete information related to the disease, the risks of infection cannot be perceived and may lead to inappropriate behavioral responses. Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic infection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of particular importance. In this letter, under the complex network framework, we study the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious individuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms, labelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A susceptible individual can be infected by U-or I-nodes, however, since the U-nodes cannot be easily …","02955075, 12864854",1.8
Influence of dynamic immunization on epidemic spreading in networks,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"We introduce a new dynamic immunization method based on the static immunization algorithm and study the relationship between dynamic and static immunization. By nodes to be immunized according to static immunization strategies, we build a connection between dynamic and static immunization. Using theoretical arguments and computational simulation we show that dynamic immunization (from a finite vaccine reservoir) is not sufficient to prevent epidemic outbreak, nor does it significantly change the asymptotic prevalence. Nonetheless, we do find that less total vaccine is required to implement this strategy. To help understand this better, we examine the extent and distribution of dynamic immunization required to achieve this reduced vaccine demand. Our results suggest that it is not necessary to increase the immunization rate when the infection rate is relatively small.",03784371,3.098

Specifically, we show that the typical geometric metrics including the correlation dimension, the multiscale entropy, and the memory effect are nearly identical between the trained reservoir computer and its learned chaotic systems. We further demonstrate this fact on a broad range of chaotic systems ranging from discrete and continuous chaotic systems to hyperchaotic systems. Our findings suggest that the successfully reservoir computer may be topologically conjugate to an observed dynamical system.","24700045, 24700053",2.266

However, the motivation for this model is entirely ad hoc. We use exact likelihood arguments and show that the optimal way to build a scale-free network is to attach most new links to nodes of low degree. Curiously, this leads to a scale-free network with a single dominant hub: a starlike structure we call a superstar network. Asymptotically, the optimal strategy is to attach each new node to one of the nodes of degree with probability proportional to (in a node network): a stronger bias toward high degree nodes than exhibited by standard preferential attachment.

Extension of the local subspace method to enhancement of speech with colored noise,Signal processing,"Based on dynamic features of human speech, the local projection (LP) method has been adapted to the enhancement of speech corrupted by white noise. As an extension of the LP method, a strategy with two rounds of projection is introduced to enhance the speech contaminated with colored noise. Colored noise mainly resides in a low dimensional subspace, and is assumed to be stationary in this communication. At step one, a noise dominated subspace is first estimated with colored noise obtained from speech silence frame. Then for the reference phase point, the components, projected into the noise dominated subspace, are deleted and the enhanced speech is reconstructed with the remaining components. The residual error of the output of step one tends to distribute uniformly on each direction. So at step two, the LP method is further applied to the output of step one, treating the residual error as white noise …","1053587X, 19410476",5.235

Key cycles are those that contribute most substantially to the dynamical behavior of the network. Second, by comparing the sensitivity of Fiedler value to different cycles, a neat index for ranking cycles is provided.

The model allows the infection and recovery rates to vary and depend on the age of infection, the time since an individual becomes infected. We address uniform persistence and find that the model has the sharp threshold property, that is, for the basic reproduction number less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while for the basic reproduction number is above one, a Lyapunov functional is used to show that the endemic equilibrium is globally stable.

Interestingly, for a chaotic time series, an exponential scaling emerges in the memory entropy analysis.

Attack resilience of the evolving scientific collaboration network,PloS one,"Stationary complex networks have been extensively studied in the last ten years. However, many natural systems are known to be continuously evolving at the local (“microscopic”) level. Understanding the response to targeted attacks of an evolving network may shed light on both how to design robust systems and finding effective attack strategies. In this paper we study empirically the response to targeted attacks of the scientific collaboration networks. First we show that scientific collaboration network is a complex system which evolves intensively at the local level – fewer than 20% of scientific collaborations last more than one year. Then, we investigate the impact of the sudden death of eminent scientists on the evolution of the collaboration networks of their former collaborators. We observe in particular that the sudden death, which is equivalent to the removal of the center of the egocentric network of the eminent scientist, does not affect the topological evolution of the residual network. Nonetheless, removal of the eminent hub node is exactly the strategy one would adopt for an effective targeted attack on a stationary network. Hence, we use this evolving collaboration network as an experimental model for attack on an evolving complex network. We find that such attacks are ineffectual, and infer that the scientific collaboration network is the trace of knowledge propagation on a larger underlying social network. The redundancy of the underlying structure in fact acts as a protection mechanism against such network attacks.",19326203,3.107
Suboptimal control and targeted constant control for semi-random epidemic networks,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","Compared with traditional models, semi-random epidemic network models may be more reasonable to describe the real dynamics of many epidemics.

We then define a centrality index which can measure average control strength of the optimal control. Based on this index, the OCP is converted into a static OCP (SOCP), whose solution is utilized to design a nonidentical constant control (NCC). NCC is suboptimal as it is optimal on a subset of the whole control set, and is determined by only the network's clustering coefficient and initial condition.

Control of layer 5 pyramidal cell spiking by oscillatory inhibition in the distal apical dendrites: a computational modeling study,Journal of Neurophysiology,"The distal apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons receive cortico-cortical and thalamocortical top-down and feedback inputs, as well as local recurrent inputs. A prominent source of recurrent inhibition in the neocortical circuit is somatostatin-positive Martinotti cells, which preferentially target distal apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. These electrically coupled cells can fire synchronously at various frequencies, including over a relatively slow range (5∼30 Hz), thereby imposing oscillatory inhibition on the pyramidal apical tuft dendrites. We examined how such distal oscillatory inhibition influences the firing of a biophysically detailed layer 5 pyramidal neuron model, which reproduced the spatiotemporal properties of sodium, calcium, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor spikes found experimentally.

Furthermore, two kinds of user network, namely, the fully connected user network and the scale-free network, are employed to model the way in which telephone users are connected.

Multiple random walks on complex networks: a harmonic law predicts search time,Physical Review E,"We investigate multiple random walks traversing independently and concurrently on complex networks and introduce the concept of mean first parallel passage time (MFPPT) to quantify their search efficiency. The mean first parallel passage time represents the expected time required to find a given target by one or some of the multiple walkers. We develop a general theory that allows us to calculate the MFPPT analytically. Interestingly, we find that the global MFPPT follows a harmonic law with respect to the global mean first passage times of the associated walkers. Remarkably, when the properties of multiple walkers are identical, the global MFPPT decays in a power law manner with an exponent of unity, irrespective of network structure.

Fitness networks for real world systems via modified preferential attachment,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"Complex networks are virtually ubiquitous, and the Barabási and Albert model (B A model) has became an acknowledged standard for the modelling of these systems. The so-called B A model is a kind of preferential attachment growth model based on the intuitive premise that popularity is attractive. However, preferential attachment alone is insufficient to describe the diversity of complex networks observed in the real world. In this paper we first use the accuracy of a link prediction method, as a metric for network fitness. The link prediction method predicts the occurrence of links consistent with preferential attachment, the performance of this link prediction scheme is then a natural measure of the” preferential-attachment-likeness” of a given network.

The result is verified by performing some numerical simulations on Star networks, Watts-Strogatz networks, and Barabási-Albert networks. Moreover, by combining optimal control and traditional pinning control, we propose an optimal pinning control strategy which depends on the network's topological structure.

Inferring networks from multivariate symbolic time series to unravel behavioural interactions among animals,Animal Behaviour,"A traditional way to quantify synchronous interactions between animals has been to use concordance indices, which commonly do not take into account the effects of the length of the sampling time and of behaviour driven by third parties.

We summarized multivariate time series using a complex network whose construction depends on a surrogate hypothesis testing data analysis of synchronous interactions between animals. The method accounts for the effect of third parties on pairwise comparisons, allows one to test the effect of the size of the sampling window on the interactions between animals, and allows one to test behavioural models of increasing complexity. We used a continuous 1-month behavioural data set of the foraging activity of a mixed-sex group of 40 Soay sheep, Ovis …","00033472, 10958282",2.189
A general stochastic model for studying time evolution of transition networks,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"We consider a class of complex networks whose nodes assume one of several possible states at any time and may change their states from time to time. Such networks represent practical networks of rumor spreading, disease spreading, language evolution, and so on. Here, we derive a model describing the dynamics of this kind of network and a simulation algorithm for studying the network evolutionary behavior. This model, derived at a microscopic level, can reveal the transition dynamics of every node. A numerical simulation is taken as an “experiment” or “realization” of the model. We use this model to study the disease propagation dynamics in four different prototypical networks, namely, the regular nearest-neighbor (RN) network, the classical Erdös–Renyí (ER) random graph, the Watts–Strogátz small-world (SW) network, and the Barabási–Albert (BA) scalefree network. We find that the disease propagation …",03784371,3.098
Dynamical influence of nodes revisited: A markov chain analysis of epidemic process on networks,Chinese Physics Letters,"We provide a theoretical analysis of node importance from the perspective of dynamical processes on networks. In particular, using Markov chain analysis of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model on networks, we derive the node importance in terms of dynamical behaviors on network in a theoretical way. It is found that this quantity happens to be the eigenvector centrality under some conditions, which bridges the topological centrality measure of the nodes with the dynamical influence of the nodes for the dynamical process. We furthermore discuss the condition under which the eigenvector centrality is valid for dynamical phenomena on networks.","0256307X, 17413540",3.634
Testing for dynamics in the irregular fluctuations of financial data,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"Price changes in financial data fluctuate irregularly or stochastically. This paper investigates whether the irregular fluctuations are random or have some kind of dynamics by applying a recently developed method, the small-shuffle surrogate method. The data used are daily gold price, daily Japanese Yen/US dollar exchange rate and tick-wise data of the Swiss Francs/US dollar exchange rate. The results indicate that irregular fluctuations in these data are not random but have some kind of dynamics.",03784371,3.098
Brain anomaly networks uncover heterogeneous functional reorganization patterns after stroke,NeuroImage: Clinical,"Stroke has a large physical, psychological, and financial burden on patients, their families, and society. Based on functional networks (FNs) constructed from resting state fMRI data, network connectivity after stroke is commonly conjectured to be more randomly reconfigured. We find that this hypothesis depends on the severity of stroke. Head movement-corrected, resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 32 patients after stroke, and 37 healthy volunteers. We constructed anomaly FNs, which combine time series information of a patient with the healthy control group. We propose data-driven techniques to automatically identify regions of interest that are stroke relevant. Graph analysis based on anomaly FNs suggests consistently that strong connections in healthy controls are broken down specifically and characteristically for brain areas that are related to sensorimotor functions and frontoparietal control systems …",22131582,3.701
Hunting for a moving target on a complex network,Europhysics Letters,"Random searching for a mobile target is frequently encountered in many real situations, posing great challenges for theoretical analysis which traditionally deals only with static targets. We investigate mobile-object search on networks in which the target's location is changing with time. We adopt mean first-encounter time to quantify the search time a searcher takes to capture a time-moving target and derive its analytical expression, when it exists. Interestingly, we observe an entirely distinct behavior for a mobile-object search compared to traditional results with a static target. Counter-intuitively, we find that compared with searching for a static target, a mobile object is easier to be captured under the same circumstances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that staying at the hub node is the optimal strategy for hunting for a mobile object on a heterogeneous network. Our findings reveal distinct effects for a mobile object on …","02955075, 12864854",1.8
Emergence of scaling and assortative mixing through altruism,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"Many social networks, apart from displaying scale-free characteristics observed in some instances, possess another remarkable feature that distinguishes them from those that appear in biological and technological context—assortativity. However, little or no attention has been payed to the mechanism of assortativity in modeling these networks. Inspired by individuals’ altruistic behavior in sociology, we develop a model with a different growth mechanism called “altruistic attachment”, which can reproduce not only the power law degree distribution but degree correlations. We study in detail the statistical properties of our network model, which we also demonstrate striking differences with the BA model, and can portray real social networks more precisely.",03784371,3.098
Enhancement of signal sensitivity in a heterogeneous neural network refined from synaptic plasticity,New Journal of Physics,"Long-term synaptic plasticity induced by neural activity is of great importance in informing the formation of neural connectivity and the development of the nervous system. It is reasonable to consider self-organized neural networks instead of prior imposition of a specific topology. In this paper, we propose a novel network evolved from two stages of the learning process, which are respectively guided by two experimentally observed synaptic plasticity rules, ie the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanism and the burst-timing-dependent plasticity (BTDP) mechanism. Due to the existence of heterogeneity in neurons that exhibit different degrees of excitability, a two-level hierarchical structure is obtained after the synaptic refinement. This self-organized network shows higher sensitivity to afferent current injection compared with alternative archetypal networks with different neural connectivity. Statistical …",13672630,2.844
Different epidemic models on complex networks,Communications in theoretical physics,"Abstract Models for diseases spreading are not just limited to SIS or SIR. For instance, for the spreading of AIDS/HIV, the susceptible individuals can be classified into different cases according to their immunity, and similarly, the infected individuals can be sorted into different classes according to their infectivity. Moreover, some diseases may develop through several stages. Many authors have shown that the individuals’ relation can be viewed as a complex network. So in this paper, in order to better explain the dynamical behavior of epidemics, we consider different epidemic models on complex networks, and obtain the epidemic threshold for each case. Finally, we present numerical simulations for each case to verify our results.",02536102,2.49
Observation of a period doubling bifurcation during onset of human ventricular fibrillation,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"We find evidence of a period doubling bifurcation and transition from pseudo-periodic chaos to a stable limit cycle during onset of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in humans. Novel radial basis modeling techniques are applied to time series of spontaneous VF to estimate time dependent changes in the dynamics. Furthermore, we show that the spectral power content may be used as a surrogate for the underlying bifurcation parameter. With this spectral power measure we demonstrate a characteristic transition from pseudo-periodic chaos to a second pseudo-periodic chaotic regime. The methods described in this paper are generic and applicable to any time series data.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Link prediction for long-circle-like networks,Physical Review Letters,"Link prediction is the problem of predicting the uncertain relationship between a pair of nodes from observed structural information of a network. Link prediction algorithms are useful in gaining insight into different network structures from partial observation of exemplars. Existing local and quasilocal link prediction algorithms with low computational complexity focus on regular complex networks with sufficiently many closed triangular motifs or on tree-like networks with the vast majority of open triangular motifs. However, the three-node motif cannot describe the local structural features of all networks, and we find the main structure of many networks is long line or closed circle that cannot be predicted well via traditional link prediction algorithms. Meanwhile, some global link prediction algorithms are effective but accompanied by high computational complexity. In this paper, we proposed a local method that is based on …","00319007, 10797114",8.106
Inclusivity enhances robustness and efficiency of social networks,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"Many modern institutions seek to be inclusive, but the quantitative benefits of this goal are not always communicated effectively to stakeholders. To facilitate this important dialogue, we propose a simple model with which to grow, in the presence of a given level of inclusivity, networks which represent the structure of organisations. The model proceeds via an unweighted random walk in which inclusivity r is the maximum allowable separation between a new contact and the set of established contacts, which thus represents the maximum tolerable amount of novelty or “otherness”. The model can capture realistic small world and scale-free properties. In addition, the model fixes the limiting degree distribution, and particular parameter choices and initial conditions also fix clustering coefficient, and so allows the role of inclusivity to be isolated from these confounding factors. By considering this model, and also by …",03784371,3.098
Constructing directed networks from multivariate time series using linear modelling technique,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"We describe a method to construct directed networks from multivariate time series which has several advantages over the widely accepted methods. This method is based on an information theoretic reduction of linear (auto-regressive) models. The models are called reduced auto-regressive (RAR) models. The procedure of the proposed method is composed of three steps: (i) each time series is treated as a basic node of a network, (ii) multivariate RAR models are built and the constituent information in the models is summarized, and (iii) nodes are connected with a directed link based on that summary information. The proposed method is demonstrated for numerical data generated by known systems, and applied to several actual time series of special interest. Although the proposed method can identify connectivity, there are three points to keep in mind: (1) the proposed method cannot always identify nonlinear …",03784371,3.098
Effects of edge directions on the structural controllability of complex networks,PLoS One,"Recent advances indicate that assigning or reversing edge direction can significantly improve the structural controllability of complex networks. For directed networks, approaching the optimal structural controllability can be achieved by detecting and reversing certain “inappropriate” edge directions. However, the existence of multiple sets of “inappropriate” edge directions suggests that different edges have different effects on optimal controllability—that is, different combinations of edges can be reversed to achieve the same structural controllability. Therefore, we classify edges into three categories based on their direction: critical, redundant and intermittent. We then investigate the effects of changing these edge directions on network controllability, and demonstrate that the existence of more critical edge directions implies not only a lower cost of modifying inappropriate edges but also better controllability. Motivated by this finding, we present a simple edge orientation method aimed at producing more critical edge directions—utilizing only local information—which achieves near optimal controllability. Furthermore, we explore the effects of edge direction on the controllability of several real networks.",19326203,3.107
Maximum entropy networks are more controllable than preferential attachment networks,Physics Letters A,"A maximum entropy (ME) method to generate typical scale-free networks has been recently introduced. We investigate the controllability of ME networks and Barabási–Albert preferential attachment networks. Our experimental results show that ME networks are significantly more easily controlled than BA networks of the same size and the same degree distribution. Moreover, the control profiles are used to provide insight into control properties of both classes of network. We identify and classify the driver nodes and analyze the connectivity of their neighbors. We find that driver nodes in ME networks have fewer mutual neighbors and that their neighbors have lower average degree. We conclude that the properties of the neighbors of driver node sensitively affect the network controllability. Hence, subtle and important structural differences exist between BA networks and typical scale-free networks of the same degree …","00036951, 10773118",3.462
Random complex networks,National Science Review,"Exactly what is meant by a ‘complex’ network is not clear; however, what is clear is that it is something other than a random graph. Complex networks arise in a wide range of real social, technological and physical systems. In all cases, the most basic categorization of these graphs is their node degree distribution. Particular groups of complex networks may exhibit additional interesting features, including the so-called small-world effect or being scale-free. There are many algorithms with which one may generate networks with particular degree distributions (perhaps the most famous of which is preferential attachment). In this paper, we address what it means to randomly choose a network from the class of networks with a particular degree distribution, and in doing so we show that the networks one gets from the preferential attachment process are actually highly pathological. Certain properties (including …","2053714X, 20955138",9.67
Changing motif distributions in complex networks by manipulating rich-club connections,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"The role of rich-club connectivity is significant in the structural property and functional behavior of complex networks. In this study, we find whether or not a very small portion of rich nodes connected to each other can strongly affect the frequency of occurrence of basic building blocks (motifs) within a heterogeneous network. Conversely whether a homogeneous network has a rich-club or not generally has no significant effect on its structure. These findings open the possibility to optimize and control the structure of complex networks by manipulating rich-club connections. Furthermore, based on the subgraph ratio profile, we develop a more rigorous approach to judge whether a network has a rich-club or not. The new method does not calculate how many links there are among rich nodes but depends on how the links among rich nodes can affect the overall structure as well as the function of a given network.",03784371,3.098
A novel metric for community detection,Europhysics Letters,"Detection of dense communities has recently attracted increasing attention within network science and various metrics for detection of such communities have been proposed. The most popular metric—modularity—is based on the rule that the links within communities are denser than external links among communities. However, the principle of this metric suffers from ambiguity, and is based on a narrow intuition of what it means to form a"" community"". Instead we propose that the defining characteristic of a community is that links are more predictable within a community rather than between communities. In this letter, based on the effect of communities on link prediction, we propose a novel metric for community detection based directly on this property. We find that our metric is more robust than traditional modularity measures for each specific algorithm. Finally, we provide a measure of the improvement offered by our …","02955075, 12864854",1.8
Cooperative output regulation problem of multi-agent systems with stochastic packet dropout and time-varying communication delay,Journal of the Franklin Institute,"In this paper, we deal with the cooperative output regulation problem of linear multi-agent systems on a directed network topology subject to both stochastic packet dropout and time-varying communication delay. On the basis of introducing a queuing mechanism, a distributed state feedback control algorithm is proposed. Then the continuous-time multi-agent systems with piece-wise constant control are converted into discrete-time systems. Under some standard assumptions, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the tracking errors of followers approach to the origin asymptotically are proposed for different exosystems.

Modeling chaotic systems: Dynamical equations vs machine learning approach,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"Chaotic systems are ubiquitous in the real world, but often analytical models remain inaccessible. We find that a machine-learning method known as “reservoir computing” provides an alternative feasible way for modeling chaotic systems rather than conventional dynamical equations. Specifically, we show that recurrence in temporal and spatial scales of the trained reservoir system are indistinguishable from that of an observed chaotic system. Furthermore, by sharing a common signal, dual synchronization between a chaotic system and its learned reservoir system can be achieved successfully. In the same manner, we show that the identical synchronization also emerges on their coupled system. These findings reveal that reservoir computing approach would be excellent candidate for modeling a great variety of chaotic systems.",10075704,3.864
Epidemic dynamics on higher-dimensional small world networks,Applied Mathematics and Computation,"Dimension governs dynamical processes on networks. The social and technological networks which we encounter in everyday life span a wide range of dimensions, but studies of spreading on finite-dimensional networks are usually restricted to one or two dimensions. To facilitate investigation of the impact of dimension on spreading processes, we define a flexible higher-dimensional small world network model and characterize the dependence of its structural properties on dimension. Subsequently, we derive mean field, pair approximation, intertwined continuous Markov chain and probabilistic discrete Markov chain models of a COVID-19-inspired susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) epidemic process with quarantine and isolation strategies, and for each model identify the basic reproduction number R 0, which determines whether an introduced infinitesimal level of infection in an initially susceptible …","00963003, 18735649",3.991
Predator-prey games on complex networks,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"We study the predator-prey game, an intriguing collective and dynamic process in nature, on complex networks. The game is over when the prey and the predator meet at the same node, where the associated mean first encounter time is used as the payoff value. We find that for a number of real networks, a saddle point will appear on the resultant payoff matrix, suggesting that each player has an optimal pure strategy. Interestingly, the prey and the predator exhibit distinct best responses. Specifically, the prey tends to move towards low-degree nodes to escape, while the predator chasing is more likely to hop to nodes with medium-degree. Moreover, in this situation, a scaling behavior of the value of the game indicates that the lifetime of the prey is very long in an infinite-size environment. Furthermore, we find that the saddle point of the predator-prey game occurs more readily on homogeneous networks rather than …",10075704,3.864
Temporal prediction of epidemic patterns in community networks,New Journal of Physics,"Most previous studies of epidemic dynamics on complex networks suppose that the disease will eventually stabilize at either a disease-free state or an endemic one. In reality, however, some epidemics always exhibit sporadic and recurrent behaviour in one region because of the invasion from an endemic population elsewhere. In this paper we address this issue and study a susceptible–infected–susceptible epidemiological model on a network consisting of two communities, where the disease is endemic in one community but alternates between outbreaks and extinctions in the other. We provide a detailed characterization of the temporal dynamics of epidemic patterns in the latter community. In particular, we investigate the time duration of both outbreak and extinction, and the time interval between two consecutive inter-community infections, as well as their frequency distributions.

Temporal evolution of nonlinear dynamics in ventricular arrhythmia,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a rapidly lethal cardiac arrhythmia and one of the leading causes of sudden death in many industrialized nations. VF appears at random, but is produced by a spatially extended excitable system. We generated VF-like ""pseudo-ECG"" signals from a numerical caricature of cardiac tissue of 100 × 100 × 50 elements. The VF-like ""pseudo-ECG"" signals represent the propagation and break-up of an excitation scroll wave under FitzHugh–Nagumo dynamics.
We use surrogate data and correlation dimension techniques to show that the dynamics observed in these computational simulations is consistent with the evolution of spontaneous VF in humans. Furthermore, we apply a novel adaptation of the traditional first return map technique to show that scroll wave break-up may be represented by a characteristic structural transition in the first return plot.

"Particle-resolved direct numerical simulation of drag force on permeable, non-spherical aggregates",Chemical Engineering Science,"Aggregation within particle suspensions is often sought to enhance settling. Aggregate settling velocity and density predictions are directly related to the drag coefficient. Despite extensive studies on aggregate drag forces, there remains a lack of explicit correlations suitable across a range of properties and flow conditions; most employ implicit approaches assuming non-spherical, porous aggregates are rigid spheres.
Particle-resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) was used to directly study drag on aggregates with various properties (void fraction, shape, orientation, fractal dimension) for Reynolds numbers between 0.13 and 2256. Testing previous implicit models against DNS results, the smallest error achieved was ~21%.

Estimating respiratory pattern variability by symbolic dynamics,Methods of information in Medicine,"Objectives: The traditional techniques of data analysis are often not sufficient to characterize the complex dynamics of respiration. In this study the respiratory pattern variability was analyzed using symbolic dynamics.

Breath duration (TTOT) time series and the relation TI/TTOT, that contains the influence of inspiratory time (TI), were considered. Length-3 words and 3 different symbols were proposed. The incidence of the overlapping τ and the parameter α were analyzed.

Identification and prediction of bifurcation tipping points using complex networks based on quasi-isometric mapping,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"Many models and real systems possess tipping points at which the state of the model or real system shifts dramatically. The ability to find any early-warnings in the vicinity of tipping points is of great importance to estimate how far the system is away from the critical point. Meanwhile, among the many schemes to convert time series into complex networks, the one-dimensional recurrence method has been proved to be a quasi-isometric mapping, and therefore retains geometric information. The quasi-isometric transformation method is adopted to discover underlying changes in systems. By measuring the characteristics of the resultant networks from time series, the changes in the system are captured. Furthermore, curve fitting is applied to expose the relation between the measures of networks and the distance between the parameter of the current state and the parameter at the tipping point for a given system …",03784371,3.098
Identification of dynamical behavior of pseudoperiodic time series by network community structure,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,"Although some transformation mappings demonstrate that different time series result in networks with distinct topological properties, it remains unclear whether the community structure in networks is related to the dynamical characteristics of the original time series. In this brief, we capture the underlying deterministic dynamics of a time series with intrinsic community structure of the corresponding network on the basis of a novel transformation method. Specifically, our findings suggest that there exist strong associations between the community structure in networks and the dynamical regimes of the time series. Emphasis is put on identifying typical characteristics of chaotic time series in terms of the variation trend of the community structure in the transformed network, especially taking the unstable periodic orbits of the dynamical system into consideration. Notably, the community structure characterizes the initial …","15497747, 15583791",4.475
An exploration and simulation of epidemic spread and its control in multiplex networks,SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics,"The outbreak of an epidemic can trigger adaptive behavioral responses from individuals---these responses will then play an important role in the spread of the infection. In order to characterize the interaction between human adaptive behaviors and epidemic spread, we propose a concrete interplay model in quenched multiplex networks. We model interaction between individuals and spread of the infection, as individual layers within the multiplex networks. Susceptibility of each individual to infection can then be mitigated by the strength of his/her adaptive behaviors, which is a direct response to information transmission.

State-space modelling of the drivers of movement behaviour in sympatric species,PLoS One,"Understanding animal movement behaviour is key to furthering our knowledge on intra- and inter-specific competition, group cohesion, energy expenditure, habitat use, the spread of zoonotic diseases or species management. We used a radial basis function surface approximation subject to minimum description length constraint to uncover the state-space dynamical systems from time series data. This approximation allowed us to infer structure from a mathematical model of the movement behaviour of sheep and red deer, and the effect of density, thermal stress and vegetation type. Animal movement was recorded using GPS collars deployed in sheep and deer grazing a large experimental plot in winter and summer. Information on the thermal stress to which animals were exposed was estimated using the power consumption of mechanical heated models and meteorological records of a network of stations in the plot. Thermal stress was higher in deer than in sheep, with less differences between species in summer. Deer travelled more distance than sheep, and both species travelled more in summer than in winter; deer travel distance showed less seasonal differences than sheep. Animal movement was better predicted in deer than in sheep and in winter than in summer; both species showed a swarming behaviour in group cohesion, stronger in deer. At shorter separation distances swarming repulsion was stronger between species than within species. At longer separation distances inter-specific attraction was weaker than intra-specific; there was a positive density-dependent effect on swarming, and stronger in deer than in sheep.

Threshold analysis of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model on overlay networks,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"In this paper, we study epidemic spreading on overlay networks in which n multiple sets of links interconnect among the same nodes. By using the microscopic Markov-chain approximation (MMA) approach, we establish the conditions of epidemic outbreak for two kinds of spreading mechanisms in such an overlay network: the concatenation case and the switching case. When a uniform infection rate is set in all the subnetworks, we find the epidemic threshold for the switching case is just n times as large as that of concatenation case. We also find that the overlay network with a uniform infection rate can be considered as an equivalent (in the sense of epidemic dynamics and epidemic threshold) weighted network. To be specific, the concatenation case corresponds to the integer weighted network, while the switching case corresponds to the fractional weighted network. Interestingly, the time-varying unweighted …",10075704,3.864
Improving resilience of high-speed train by optimizing repair strategies,Reliability Engineering & System Safety,"High-speed trains (HSTs) are used to transport passengers to destinations efficiently and safely. However, when HST units fail, strategies for repairing them are not available. Hence, to optimize repair strategies, an interdependent network is used to model an HST, and a metric of resilience based on network theory is introduced. Based on practical factors, an interdependent machine–electricity–communication network (IMECN) and related cascading failure models are developed. Comprehensive robustness metrics for the IMECN and nodes are proposed considering the topology of networks and functional features of nodes. Accordingly, a resilience optimization model of the IMECN subject to disturbances is formulated and solved using a tabu search (TS) algorithm.

Tracking a single pigeon using a shadowing filter algorithm,Ecology and Evolution,"Miniature GPS devices now allow for measurement of the movement of animals in real time and provide high‐ quality and high‐resolution data. While these new data sets are a great improvement, one still encounters some measurement errors as well as device failures. Moreover, these devices only measure position and require further reconstruction techniques to extract the full dynamical state space with the velocity and acceleration. Direct differentiation of position is generally not adequate. We report on the successful implementation of a shadowing filter algorithm that (1) minimizes measurement errors and (2) reconstructs at the same time the full phase‐space from a position recording of a flying pigeon. This filter is based on a very simple assumption that the pigeon's dynamics are Newtonian. We explore not only how to choose the filter's parameters but also demonstrate its improvements over other …",20457758,2.297
Global behavior of epidemic transmission on heterogeneous networks via two distinct routes,Nonlinear Biomedical Physics,"In the study of epidemic spreading two natural questions are: whether the spreading of epidemics on heterogenous networks have multiple routes, and whether the spreading of an epidemic is a local or global behavior?

Complex networks are now widely used in the analysis of time series from a complex system. In this paper, we investigate the scope of network methods to indicate tipping points. In particular, we verify that the permutation entropy of transition networks constructed from time series observations of the logistic map can distinguish periodic and chaotic regimes and indicate bifurcations. The permutation entropy of transition networks, the mean edge betweenness of visibility graphs and the number of code words in compression networks, are each shown to indicate the onset of transition of a pitchfork bifurcation system. Our study shows that network methods are effective in detecting transitions.

Comparing capability of scenario hazard identification methods by the PIC (Plant-People-Procedure Interaction Contribution) network metric,Safety science,"Comparing the results of hazard identification (HAZID) methods is a complex task, but the question that drives this activity is vitally important: which HAZID method should be used to best identify an accident scenario? Despite many efforts to address this, effective metrics do not yet readily exist for clearly comparing HAZID results for a particular scenario. The complexity of socio-technical systems is often cited as a key factor that limits effective scenario identification, calling into question traditional HAZID efforts. Motivated by the observation that interactions between multiple component types, such as People, Plant and Procedures (P3), often significantly contribute to major process system accidents, being an expression of the complexity of the system, a novel, precise, network topology-based metric for calculating the contribution of P3 Interactions to accident scenarios is presented.

Modelling and tracking the flight dynamics of flocking pigeons based on real GPS data (small flock),Ecological Modelling,"Improvements in our ability to collect and process real-time data from animal behaviour have lead to increasing interest in the quantitative analysis of collective motion in various species. This motion can be characterised as movement of a group of animals that interact among themselves and with the surrounding environment to preserve the cohesive form of the group. Examples of this motion include a flock of birds, a fish school and a group of deer or sheep. The problem becomes particularly challenging as the group dynamics and the individual dynamics need to be disentangled for biological analysis. Within this framework we describe a new mathematical technique that may be applied in order to understand animals group movement and behaviour.

Improved parameter estimation from noisy time series for nonlinear dynamical systems,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"In this paper we consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system given a finite time series of observations that are contaminated by observational noise. The least squares method is a standard method for parameter estimation, but for nonlinear dynamical systems it is well known that the least squares method can result in biased estimates, especially when the noise is significant relative to the nonlinearity. In this paper, it is demonstrated that by combining nonlinear noise reduction and least squares parameter fitting it is possible to obtain more accurate parameter estimates.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Synchronization of machine learning oscillators in complex networks,Information Sciences,"We study synchronization phenomena in complex networks in terms of machine learning oscillators without conventional dynamical equations. Specifically, we adopt an effective machine learning technique known as reservoir computing for modeling dynamical systems of interest. By constructing a coupled configuration, we show that a collection of coupled reservoir oscillators are in identical synchrony over a wider window of coupling strengths. We find that the geometrical and dynamical properties of synchronous orbits are in excellent agreement with that of the learned dynamical system. Remarkably, through this synchronization scheme, we successfully recover an almost identical bifurcation behavior of an observed system via merely its chaotic dynamics. Our work provides an alternative framework for studying synchronization phenomena in nature when only observed data are available.",00200255,7.887
Consistency hierarchy of reservoir computers,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,"We study the propagation and distribution of information-carrying signals injected in dynamical systems serving as reservoir computers. Through different combinations of repeated input signals, a multivariate correlation analysis reveals measures known as the consistency spectrum and consistency capacity. These are high-dimensional portraits of the nonlinear functional dependence between input and reservoir state. For multiple inputs, a hierarchy of capacities characterizes the interference of signals from each source. For an individual input, the time-resolved capacities form a profile of the reservoir’s nonlinear fading memory. We illustrate this methodology for a range of echo state networks.","2162237X, 21622388",11.831
Dynamical systems induced on networks constructed from time series,Entropy,"Several methods exist to construct complex networks from time series. In general, these methods claim to construct complex networks that preserve certain properties of the underlying dynamical system, and hence, they mark new ways of accessing quantitative indicators based on that dynamics. In this paper, we test this assertion by developing an algorithm to realize dynamical systems from these complex networks in such a way that trajectories of these dynamical systems produce time series that preserve certain statistical properties of the original time series (and hence, also the underlying true dynamical system). Trajectories from these networks are constructed from only the information in the network and are shown to be statistically equivalent to the original time series. In the context of this algorithm, we are able to demonstrate that the so-called adaptive k-nearest neighbour algorithm for generating networks out-performs methods based on ϵ-ball recurrence plots. For such networks, and with a suitable choice of parameter values, which we provide, the time series generated by this method function as a new kind of nonlinear surrogate generation algorithm. With this approach, we are able to test whether the simulation dynamics built from a complex network capture the underlying structure of the original system; whether the complex network is an adequate model of the dynamics.",10994300,2.509
Unraveling complexity in interspecies interaction through nonlinear dynamical models,acta ethologica,"Unraveling complex interactions between animal species is of paramount importance to understand competition, facilitation, and community assembly processes. Using data from GPS positions of sheep (Ovis aries) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) grazing a moorland plot, we modeled the animal movement of each species as a function of the distance between individuals, with the aim to assess the role of animal interactions (i.e., attraction and repulsion) in their spatial movement. We used black box-based models. These models do not require making assumptions about the biological meaning of their parameters. They are data-driven and use embedding complex algorithms that create nonlinear functions that estimate the behavior of the system, in our case the movement of our animals, and its errors.

Binding under conflict conditions: State–space analysis of multivariate EEG synchronization,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,"Real-world objects are often endowed with features that violate Gestalt principles. In our experiment, we examined the neural correlates of binding under conflict conditions in terms of the binding-by-synchronization hypothesis. We presented an ambiguous stimulus (“diamond illusion”) to 12 observers. The display consisted of four oblique gratings drifting within circular apertures. Its interpretation fluctuates between bound (“diamond”) and unbound (component gratings) percepts. To model a situation in which Gestalt-driven analysis contradicts the perceptually explicit bound interpretation, we modified the original diamond (OD) stimulus by speeding up one grating. Using OD and modified diamond (MD) stimuli, we managed to dissociate the neural correlates of Gestalt-related (OD vs. MD) and perception-related (bound vs. unbound) factors. Their interaction was expected to reveal the neural networks …","0898929X, 15308898",2.875

Nonlinear dynamical system identification with dynamic noise and observational noise,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,In this paper we consider the problem of whether a nonlinear system has dynamic noise and then estimate the level of dynamic noise to add to any model we build. The method we propose relies on a nonlinear model and an improved least squares method recently proposed on the assumption that observational noise is not large. We do not need any a priori knowledge for systems to be considered and we can apply the method to both maps and flows. We demonstrate with applications to artificial and experimental data. The results indicate that applying the proposed method can detect presence or absence of dynamic noise from scalar time series and give a reliable level of dynamic noise to add to the model built in some cases.,01672789,3.117
Modeling nonlinear time series using improved least squares method,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"We improve the least squares (LS) method for building models of a nonlinear dynamical system given finite time series which are contaminated by observational noise. When the noise level is low, the LS method gives good estimates for the parameters, however, the models selected as the best by information criteria often tend to be over-parameterized or even degenerate. We observe that the correct model is not selected as the best model despite belonging to the chosen model class. To overcome this, we propose a simple but very effective idea to use the LS method more appropriately. We apply the method for model selection. Numerical studies indicate that the method can be used to apply information criteria more effectively, and generally avoid over-fitting and model degeneracy.","02181274, 17936551",2.088

However it is natural to ask whether there is any difference between feeling the pulse on the wrist or at any other part of the body: such as the fingertips at which it is easily measured by electronic devices. We employ a series of neural networks to model blood pressure propagation from the wrist to the fingertip. In order to avoid the problem of over-fitting we apply information theoretic criterion to determine the optimal model in these networks and then apply surrogate data method to the residuals in this model. We demonstrate the application of this method to recordings of human pulse in six subjects. Our result indicates that there is no significant difference between pulse waveform measure on the lateral arterial artery (wrist) and at the fingertip.,"01290657, 17936462",6.117
Variation in the dominant period during ventricular fibrillation,IEEE transactions on biomedical engineering,"Time-varying periodicities are commonly observed in biological time series. Here, the authors discuss three different algorithms to detect and quantify change in periodicity. Each technique uses a sliding window to estimate periodic components in short subseries of a longer recording. The three techniques the authors utilize are based on: 1) standard Fourier spectral estimation; 2) an information theoretic adaption of linear (autoregressive) modeling; and 3) geometric properties of the embedded time series. The authors compare the results obtained from each of these methods using artificial data and experimental data from swine ventricular fibrillation (VF). Spectral estimates have previously been applied to VF time series to show a time-dependent trend in the dominant frequency.

Testing for linear and nonlinear Gaussian processes in nonstationary time series,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"Surrogate data methods have been widely applied to produce synthetic data, while maintaining the same statistical properties as the original. By using such methods, one can analyze certain properties of time series. In this context, Theiler's surrogate data methods are the most commonly considered approaches. These are based on the Fourier transform, limiting them to be applied only on stationary time series. Consequently, time series including nonstationary behavior, such as trend, produces spurious high frequencies with Theiler's methods, resulting in inconsistent surrogates. To solve this problem, we present two new methods that combine time series decomposition techniques and surrogate data methods. These new methods initially decompose time series into a set of monocomponents and the trend. Afterwards, traditional surrogate methods are applied on those individual monocomponents and a set of …","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Quantifying network properties in multi-electrode recordings: spatiotemporal characterization and inter-trial variation of evoked gamma oscillations in mouse somatosensory …,Frontiers in computational neuroscience,"Linking the structural connectivity of brain circuits to their cooperative dynamics and emergent functions is a central aim of neuroscience research. Graph theory has recently been applied to study the structure-function relationship of networks, where dynamical similarity of different nodes has been turned into a “static” functional connection. However, the capability of the brain to adapt, learn and process external stimuli requires a constant dynamical functional rewiring between circuitries and cell assemblies. Hence, we must capture the changes of network functional connectivity over time. Multi-electrode array data present a unique challenge within this framework. We study the dynamics of gamma oscillations in acute slices of the somatosensory cortex from juvenile mice recorded by planar multi-electrode arrays. Bursts of gamma oscillatory activity lasting a few hundred milliseconds could be initiated only by brief trains of electrical stimulations applied at the deepest cortical layers and simultaneously delivered at multiple locations. Local field potentials were used to study the spatio-temporal properties and the instantaneous synchronization profile of the gamma oscillatory activity, combined with current source density (CSD) analysis. Pair-wise differences in the oscillation phase were used to determine the presence of instantaneous synchronization between the different sites of the circuitry during the oscillatory period. Despite variation in the duration of the oscillatory response over successive trials, they showed a constant average power, suggesting that the rate of expenditure of energy during the gamma bursts is consistent across repeated …",16625188,2.388
Dynamical diversity induced by individual responsive immunization,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications,"A voluntary vaccination allows for a healthy individual to choose vaccination according to the individual’s local information. Hence, vaccination has the potential to provide a complex negative feedback (non-infection decreases propensity for vaccination, hence increasing infection and vice versa). In this paper, we investigate a kind of SIS epidemic model with a deterministic and voluntary vaccination scheme in scale-free networks. We first study a threshold model with no historical information. By using the comparative method we confirm that under some conditions there exist two critical values of infection rates to determine three kinds of epidemic dynamical behaviors: the epidemic spread, the asymptotical decay and the exponential decay. Furthermore, a mean-field approximation model can predict the maximal infection level but cannot predict the existence of two critical infection rates. In numerical simulations …",03784371,3.098
Impact of gamma-oscillatory inhibition on the signal transmission of a cortical pyramidal neuron,Cognitive neurodynamics,"Networks of synchronized fast-spiking interneurons are thought to be key elements in the generation of gamma (γ) oscillations (30–80 Hz) in the brain. We examined how such γ-oscillatory inhibition regulates the output of a cortical pyramidal cell. Specifically, we modeled a situation where a pyramidal cell receives inputs from γ-synchronized fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons. This model successfully reproduced several important aspects of a recent experimental result regarding the γ-inhibitory regulation of pyramidal cellular firing that is presumably associated with the sensation of whisker stimuli. Through an in-depth analysis of this model system, we show that there is an obvious rhythmic gating effect of the γ-oscillated interneuron networks on the pyramidal neuron’s signal transmission. This effect is further illustrated by the interactions of this interneuron network and the pyramidal neuron. Prominent …","18714080, 18714099",4.413
Oscillations and phase transition in the mean infection rate of a finite population,International Journal of Modern Physics C,"We consider epidemic transmission in a finite population with both scale-free network structure and heterogeneous infection rates related to both susceptibility and infectiousness of individuals. The restriction to a finite population size and heterogeneity are included so that the model more closely matches reality. In particular, the arithmetic average behavior of heterogeneous infection rates with node-degree correlation is discussed. Through numerical simulations, we find that the average infection rate presents robust small-amplitude oscillations. Based on this property, we propose a statistical measure of the system dynamics — the epidemic spreading efficiency (ESE) — and discuss its phase transitions as a function of the various system parameters. The results show that the ESE presents a non-continuous phase transition and the ESE threshold is an extension of the epidemic threshold from the case of …","01291831, 17936586",1.786
Estimating the distribution of dynamic invariants: illustrated with an application to human photo-plethysmographic time series,Nonlinear Biomedical Physics,"Dynamic invariants are often estimated from experimental time series with the aim of differentiating between different physical states in the underlying system. The most popular schemes for estimating dynamic invariants are capable of estimating confidence intervals, however, such confidence intervals do not reflect variability in the underlying dynamics. We propose a surrogate based method to estimate the expected distribution of values under the null hypothesis that the underlying deterministic dynamics are stationary. We demonstrate the application of this method by considering four recordings of human pulse waveforms in differing physiological states and show that correlation dimension and entropy are insufficient to differentiate between these states. In contrast, algorithmic complexity can clearly differentiate between all four rhythms.",17534631,0.0

Moreover, we demonstrate that the data is not consistent with a monotonic nonlinear transformation of linearly filtered noise (i.e. determinism in the data cannot be adequately described by the Fourier power spectrum). We then show that for four of the five vowel sounds, the dynamics are not consistent with a noise driven nonlinear periodic orbit, and therefore the underlying dynamical system is likely to be chaotic. In the fifth case (the vowel /u/) we are unable to reject the hypothesis of a noise driven periodic orbit.",-,153.0

Permutation entropy of state transition networks to detect synchronization,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"The dynamic behavior of many physical, biological, and other systems, are organized according to the synchronization of chaotic oscillators.

We show that this method can detect different kinds of synchronization such as complete synchronization, phase synchronization, and generalized synchronization. In all cases, the estimated permutation entropy decreases with increased synchronization. This method is also capable of estimating the topology of the network graph from the time series, without knowledge of the dynamical equations of individual nodes.

The active selfish herd,Journal of Theoretical Biology,"The selfish herd hypothesis provides an explanation for group aggregation via the selfish avoidance of predators. Conceptually, and as was first proposed, this movement should aim to minimise the danger domain of each individual. Whilst many reasonable proxies have been proposed, none have directly sought to reduce the danger domain. In this work we present a two dimensional stochastic model that actively optimises these domains. The individuals’ dynamics are determined by sampling the space surrounding them and moving to achieve the largest possible domain reduction. Two variants of this idea are investigated with sampling occurring either locally or globally. We simulate our models and two of the previously proposed benchmark selfish herd models: k-nearest neighbours (kNN); and local crowded horizon (LCH).

Different epidemic models on complex networks,Communications in Theoretical Physics,"Models for diseases spreading are not just limited to SIS or SIR.

Moreover, some diseases may develop through several stages. Many authors have shown that the individuals' relation can be viewed as a complex network.

Multiple sensors data integration for traffic incident detection using the quadrant scan,Sensors,"Non-recurrent congestion disrupts normal traffic operations and lowers travel time (TT) reliability, which leads to many negative consequences such as difficulties in trip planning, missed appointments, loss in productivity, and driver frustration. Traffic incidents are one of the six causes of non-recurrent congestion. Early and accurate detection helps reduce incident duration, but it remains a challenge due to the limitation of current sensor technologies. In this paper, we employ a recurrence-based technique, the Quadrant Scan, to analyse time series traffic volume data for incident detection. The data is recorded by multiple sensors along a section of urban highway. The results show that the proposed method can detect incidents better by integrating data from the multiple sensors in each direction, compared to using them individually. It can also distinguish non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by incidents from recurrent congestion. The results show that the Quadrant Scan is a promising algorithm for real-time traffic incident detection with a short delay. It could also be extended to other non-recurrent congestion types.",14248220,4.246
Data-driven approach for labelling process plant event data,International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management,"An essential requirement in any data analysis is to have a response variable representing the aim of the analysis. Much academic work is based on laboratory or simulated data, where the experiment is controlled, and the ground truth clearly defined. This is seldom the reality for equipment performance in an industrial environment and it is common to find issues with the response variable in industry situations. We discuss this matter using a case study where the problem is to detect an asset event (failure) using data available but for which no ground truth is available from historical records. Our data frame contains measurements of 14 sensors recorded every minute from a process control system and 4 current motors on the asset of interest over a three year period. In this situation the``how to''label the event of interest is of fundamental importance. Different labelling strategies will generate different models with direct impact on the in-service fault detection efficacy of the resulting model. We discuss a data-driven approach to label a binary response variable (fault/anomaly detection) and compare it to a rule-based approach. Labelling of the time series was performed using dynamic time warping followed by agglomerative hierarchical clustering to group events with similar event dynamics. Both data sets have significant imbalance with 1,200,000 non-event data but only 150 events in the rule-based data set and 64 events in the data-driven data set.

We employ the SIR-UAU model with a time dependent coefficient to denote information dissemination. We found that major social events are equivalent to perturbations of information dissemination in certain time intervals and will consequently weaken the effect of information dissemination, and increase prevalence of infection.

Objective domain boundaries detection in new Caledonian nickel laterite from spectra using quadrant scan,Minerals,"Modelling of 3D domain boundaries using information from drill holes is a standard procedure in mineral exploration and mining. Manual logging of drill holes can be difficult to exploit as the results may not be comparable between holes due to the subjective nature of geological logging. Exploration and mining companies commonly collect geochemical or mineralogical data from diamond drill core or drill chips; however, manual interpretation of multivariate data can be slow and challenging; therefore, automation of any of the steps in the interpretation process would be valuable. Hyperspectral analysis of drill chips provides a relatively inexpensive method of collecting very detailed information rapidly and consistently. However, the challenge of such data is the high dimensionality of the data’s variables in comparison to the number of samples. Hyperspectral data is usually processed to produce mineral abundances generally involving a range of assumptions. This paper presents the results of testing a new fast and objective methodology to identify the lithological boundaries from high dimensional hyperspectral data. This method applies a quadrant scan analysis to recurrence plots. The results, applied to nickel laterite deposits from New Caledonia, demonstrate that this method can identify transitions in the downhole data. These are interpreted as reflecting mineralogical changes that can be used as an aid in geological logging to improve boundary detection.",2075163X,2.334

From local uncertainty to global predictions: Making predictions on fractal basins,Plos one,"In nonlinear systems long term dynamics is governed by the attractors present in phase space. The presence of a chaotic saddle gives rise to basins of attraction with fractal boundaries and sometimes even to Wada boundaries. These two phenomena involve extreme difficulties in the prediction of the future state of the system. However, we show here that it is possible to make statistical predictions even if we do not have any previous knowledge of the initial conditions or the time series of the system until it reaches its final state. In this work, we develop a general method to make statistical predictions in systems with fractal basins. In particular, we have applied this new method to the Duffing oscillator for a choice of parameters where the system possesses the Wada property. We have computed the statistical properties of the Duffing oscillator for different phase space resolutions, to obtain information about the global dynamics of the system. The key idea is that the fraction of initial conditions that evolve towards each attractor is scale free—which we illustrate numerically. We have also shown numerically how having partial information about the initial conditions of the system does not improve in general the predictions in the Wada regions.",19326203,3.107
Bipartite centrality diffusion: mining higher-order network structures via motif-vertex interactions,Europhysics Letters,"Understanding network structures at the level of functional building blocks, also known as network motifs, is of crucial importance for many real-world applications. In this work, we develop a framework to model the interactions between high-order motif instances and graph nodes using a bipartite graph. The roles of motif instances can then be revealed via the latent feature embeddings resultant from the bipartite graph. In contrast to existing methods, our work is among the first attempts to explicitly study the relation between motif instances by bridging them naturally with the original nodes in the graph. Moreover, the proximity on the high-order centrality measure of motif instances and nodes are found to coincide with the high-order clustering organization in the networks. Our approach demonstrates significant performance on a number of real-world network datasets.","02955075, 12864854",1.8
Epidemic threshold determined by the first moments of network with alternating degree distributions,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications,"During the alternating day–night cycle, people have differing behavior and hence different connection patterns—such as going to work or home, shopping and so on. Hence, the true topological structure of human contact networks are not only time-varying but also exhibit certain distribution regularity. In this paper, we will investigate epidemic spreading on time-varying human contact networks, which follow one degree distribution during daytime, but another at night. Based on SIS (susceptible/infected/susceptible) propagation mechanism, we study the epidemic threshold of this network with alternating distributions. A surprising result is that for the discrete-time case the epidemic threshold is determined only by the first moments of the two alternating degree distributions, if the degree of each node is constant for all nights. A similar result is valid for the continuous-time case if the duration is sufficiently small. This …",03784371,3.098
Uncovering bifurcation patterns in cortical synapses,Journal of mathematical biology,"Individual cortical synapses are known to exhibit a very complex short-time dynamic behaviour in response to simple “naturalistic” stimulation. We describe a computational study of the experimentally obtained excitatory post-synaptic potential trains of individual cortical synapses. By adopting a new nonlinear modelling scheme we construct robust and repeatable models of the underlying dynamics. These models suggest that cortical synapses exhibit a wide range of either periodic or chaotic dynamics. For stimulus at a fixed rate our models predict that the response of the individual synapse will vary from a fixed point to periodic and chaotic, depending on the frequency of stimulus. Dynamics for individual synapses vary widely, suggesting that the individual behaviour of synapses is highly tuned and that the dynamic behaviour of even a small network of synapse-coupled neurons could be extremely varied.","03036812, 14321416",2.145
A Surrogate Test for Pseudo‐periodic Time Series Data,AIP Conference Proceedings,"Standard (linear) surrogate methods are only useful for time series exhibiting no pseudo‐periodic structure. We describe a new algorithm that can distinguish between a noisy periodic orbit and deterministic non‐periodic inter‐cycle dynamics. Possible origins of deterministic non‐periodic inter‐cycle dynamics include: non‐periodic linear or nonlinear dynamics, or chaos. This new algorithm is based on mimicking the large‐scale dynamics with a local model, but obliterating the fine scale features with dynamic noise. We demonstrate the application of this method to artificial data and experimental time series, including human electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings during sinus rhythm and ventricular tachycardia (VT). The method is able to successfully differentiate between the chaotic Rössler system and a pseudo periodic realization of the Rössler equations with dynamic noise.

The distinct roles of initial transmission and retransmission in the persistence of knowledge in complex networks,Applied Mathematics and Computation,"The rate of successfully acquiring knowledge depends on whether the individual has previously held that knowledge. In an earlier work, we represented this phenomenon by dividing the dynamical process of knowledge transmission into initial and retransmission stages, and applied mean field theory to identify an approximate condition for knowledge survival on homogeneous networks. In this work we move beyond our earlier, approximate results for homogeneous networks to provide rigorous results applicable to complex networks of arbitrary topology - including heterogeneous real world social networks. Specifically, we extend the Intertwined Continuous Markov Chain (ICMC) and Probabilistic Discrete Markov Chain (PDMC) models to address the Naive-Evangelical-Agnostic-Evangelical (VEAE) knowledge transmission process in complex networks.

Estimating dynamical dimensions from noisy observations,Information Sciences,"Knowledge of the dynamical dimension mitigates the “curse of dimensionality” by permitting analysis in dimension lower than that of the original state vectors. The description length quantifies complexity and so allows us to use Occam’s razor to estimate the dynamical dimension underlying noisily observed data. Applying our method, based on the description length, to a coarsely sampled scalar time series requires the choice of only one parameter; an embedding dimension. For the three systems considered in this study observed amid observational noise, a single choice of embedding dimension does provide reasonable estimates of the dynamical dimension. The spatial distribution of local estimates of dynamical dimension aids visualisation and provides extra insight into the geometric structure of many systems.",00200255,7.887
Global stability and optimal control of epidemics in heterogeneously structured populations exhibiting adaptive behavior,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"We present a novel SIRS model on scale-free networks that takes into account behavioral memory and time delay to depict an adaptive behavioral feedback mechanism, which can better characterize the actual spread of epidemics. We conduct rigorous analysis on the dynamics of the model, including the basic reproduction number R 0, uniform persistence and the global asymptotic stability of equilibria. The model has the sharp threshold property, namely, if R 0 is less than 1 then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable while if R 0 is larger than 1 then the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. We further perform an optimal control study for the model to seek effective vaccination and treatment strategies. The existence and uniqueness of these optimal control strategies are demonstrated. Finally, we perform some stochastic network simulations that yield quantitative agreement …",10075704,3.864
Characterisation of neonatal cardiac dynamics using ordinal partition network,Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing,"The maturation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) starts in the gestation period and it is completed after birth in a variable time, reaching its peak in adulthood. However, the development of ANS maturation is not entirely understood in newborns. Clinically, the ANS condition is evaluated with monitoring of gestational age, Apgar score, heart rate, and by quantification of heart rate variability using linear methods. Few researchers have addressed this problem from the perspective nonlinear data analysis. This paper proposes a new data-driven methodology using nonlinear time series analysis, based on complex networks, to classify ANS conditions in newborns. We map 74 time series given by RR intervals from premature and full-term newborns to ordinal partition networks and use complexity quantifiers to discriminate the dynamical process present in both conditions.

Representing complex networks without connectivity via spectrum series,Information Sciences,"We propose a new paradigm for describing complex networks in terms of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix and its submatrices. We show that a variety of basic node information, such as degree, clique, and subgraph centrality, can be calculated analytically. Moreover, we find that energy of spectrum series can uncover randomness and complexity of network structure. Interestingly, it presents an universal linear growth pattern with the growth of networks. Furthermore, the spectrum series of synthetic and real networks present clearly self-similarity characteristics for which the associated scaling exponents remain constant. Our work reveals that spectrum series representation will provide an alternative perspective for studying and understanding structure and function of complex networks rather than connectivity.",00200255,7.887
Exploring the optimal network topology for spreading dynamics,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"Complex networks are a useful method to model many real-world systems from society to biology. Spreading dynamics of complex networks has attracted more and more attention and is currently an area of intense interest. In this study, by applying a perturbation approach to an individual-based susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) model, we derive an estimation of the incremental spreading prevalence after the network adds a single link and then propose a strategy to find the corresponding optimal link to promote spreading prevalence. Through theoretical analysis, we notice that the proposed strategy can be approximately interpreted by the eigenvector centrality when the infection probability is near the spreading critical point. By comparing the incremental prevalence of several typical synthetic and real networks, we find that the proposed strategy is superior to other methods such as linking nodes with the …",03784371,3.098

Time series network induced subgraph distance as a metonym for dynamical invariants,Europhysics Letters,"The complex behaviour of dynamical systems can be discovered through the study of observed scalar time series via reconstruction of a suitable state space. Reconstruction can readily be achieved thanks to Takens embedding theorem and further insights about a system can be found by constructing complex networks based on the proximity to each other of these reconstructed states. An example of such a proximity network is the so-called phase space network which is a type of recurrence network. The structure and properties of these networks, including small induced subgraphs within them, describe the spatial distribution of reconstructed states in a way different from, but related to, correlation dimension. Beyond the makeup of the reconstructed states the time structure inherent in the time series is typically ignored in any subsequent analysis of proximity networks.

A surrogate technique for investigating deterministic dynamics in discrete human movement,Motor Control,"Entropy is an effective tool for investigation of human movement variability. However, before applying entropy, it can be beneficial to employ analyses to confirm that observed data are not solely the result of stochastic processes. This can be achieved by contrasting observed data with that produced using surrogate methods. Unlike continuous movement, no appropriate method has been applied to discrete human movement. This article proposes a novel surrogate method for discrete movement data, outlining the processes for determining its critical values. The proposed technique reliably generated surrogates for discrete joint angle time series, destroying fine-scale dynamics of the observed signal, while maintaining macro structural characteristics. Comparison of entropy estimates indicated observed signals had greater regularity than surrogates and were not only the result of stochastic but also deterministic …","10871640, 15432696",0.927

Chaos synchronization of two coupled map lattice systems using safe reinforcement learning,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","When synchronizing two continuous typical chaotic systems, the state variables of the response system are usually bounded and satisfy the Lipschitz condition. This permits a universal synchronization method. In the synchronization of two high-dimensional discrete chaotic systems such as the coupled map lattice systems, the state variables of the response system often diverge, which makes it difficult to seek a universal synchronization method. To overcome this difficulty, bounded and hard constraints, which correspond to the concept of safety level III in reinforcement learning terms, on the state variables must be imposed, when the discrete response system is perturbed. We propose a universal method for synchronizing two discrete systems based on safe reinforcement learning (RL). In this method, the RL agent’s policy is used to reach the goal of synchronization and a safety layer added directly on top of the …",09600779,5.969
Network Spreading from Network Dimension,Physical Review Letters,"Continuous-state network spreading models provide critical numerical and analytic insights into transmission processes in epidemiology, rumor propagation, knowledge dissemination, and many other areas. Most of these models reflect only local features such as adjacency, degree, and transitivity, so can exhibit substantial error in the presence of global correlations typical of empirical networks. Here, we propose mitigating this limitation via a network property ideally suited to capturing spreading. This is the network correlation dimension, which characterizes how the number of nodes within range of a source typically scales with distance. Applying the approach to susceptible-infected-recovered processes leads to a spreading model which, for a wide range of networks and epidemic parameters, can provide more accurate predictions of the early stages of a spreading process than important established models of …","00319007, 10797114",8.106

Faint phase synchronization detection through structured orthomax rotations in singular spectrum analysis,Physical Review E,"Multivariate singular spectrum analysis (M-SSA), with a structured varimax rotation, is a method that allows a deep characterization of phase synchronization (PS) phenomena in an almost automatic fashion. It has been increasingly used in the study of PS in networks of nonlinear, real-world, and numeric systems. This paper investigates the impact of the other recently developed structured orthomax rotations on the M-SSA ability to characterize PS. The results show that by using the structured quartimax rotation, a very faint and intermittent PS regime can be detected, in contrast with the structured varimax (which demands a stronger, more consolidated PS regime). This is due to the fact that the different rotations do not have the same efficiency in achieving a simple structure of the M-SSA eigenvectors. Nevertheless, for well-established PS regimes, the same robustness of the original M-SSA approach against high …","24700045, 24700053",2.266
Long-range correlation properties of stationary linear models with mixed periodicities,Physical Review E,"We consider the problem of (stationary and linear) source systems which generate time series data with long-range correlations. We use the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and build stationary linear models using artificial time series data exhibiting a spectrum, where the models can include only terms that contribute significantly to the model as assessed by information criteria. The result is that the optimal (best) model is only composed of mixed periodicities [that is, the model does not include all (continuous) periodicities] and the time series data generated by the model exhibit a clear spectrum in a wide frequency range. It is considered that as the spectrum is a consequence of the contributions of all periods, consecutive periods are indispensable to generate such data by stationary linear models.

Understanding rhythmic dynamics and synchronization in human gait through dimensionality reduction,PLoS Comput. Biol,"Complex physiological rhythms and synchronization processes are ubiquitous in biological systems and are fundamental to life [1]. The human heartbeat [2, 3], walking [4] and vocal cords vibration [5], blood pressure and respiration [6], white blood-cell count and tremor in patients [7, 8], epidemic dynamics [9] all demonstrate stable oscillatory patterns but highly irregular fluctuations over time, and these signals are also known as approximately periodic or pseudoperiodic data. The fluctuation overlying the oscillatory patterns, or specifically, the cycle-to-cycle variability, arise from the combined effects from the changing environment, nonlinear nature inherent in biological systems, and noise. It contains a wealth of information regarding the health or disease status of an individual subject. Usually, little or no a priori knowledge or models that governs the underlying system are available. Therefore reliably characterizing and quantifying such biological rhythms through data-driven approaches have important applications in diagnosis of disease and the understanding of dynamics of biologic control systems [10]. Traditionally, rhythmic signals are fruitfully analyzed by linear methods like Fourier transform and power spectrum analysis. However, physiological signals as outputs of complex biological systems are typically nonlinear and non-stationary, which can not be properly characterized by linear methods.

Two-strain epidemic models on scale-free networks with saturated infectivity,Preprint,"In this paper we study disease transmission with two distinct strains from the same pathogen on scale-free networks with saturated infection rates. By using a meanfield method, we build two-strain epidemic models according to both a perfect crossimmunity mechanism and a super-infection mechanism. The epidemic dynamics on complex networks is generally determined by network structure, infectious mechanism; and interaction manner between strains. We examine strain coexistence, strain replacement, and strain dominance, and show good agreement between theory and numerical simulations. We find that different interaction mechanisms can lead to different effects. For example, super-infection mechanism is always related to strain replacement, but perfect cross-immunity mechanism can not generate this phenomenon. For the perfect cross-immunity case, when two BRNs are different, strains can not coexist indefinitely in the network. But if they are the same, the two strains can get coexist. For the super-infection case, the situation is more complicated. Strain replacement is vital to control disease transmission. The strain with smaller BRN can also become predominant under the other asymmetric factors of the two strains. So asymmetric features leads to strain replacement. Strain domination occurs when strain I dominate the epidemic (irrespective of whether it is strain I or strain J) eventually. For the above two models, strain domination can occur under several conditions.",05693772,0.0

Two kinds of chaotic maps, the period doubling system and the Hopf bifurcation system, are employed as basic models to analyze and compare in detail the different mechanisms of inducing and enhancing chaos in them. In addition, a special kind of intermittency characterized by its periodicity is found for the first time in periodically perturbed Henon map, and reasonable speculations are presented to explain its complicated dynamics.","02181274, 17936551",2.088
Mapping clinical interactions in an Australian tertiary hospital emergency department for patients presenting with risk of suicide or self-harm: Network modeling from …,PLoS Medicine,"Background
Reliable assessment of suicide and self-harm risk in emergency medicine is critical for effective intervention and treatment of patients affected by mental health disorders. Teams of clinicians face the challenge of rapidly integrating medical history, wide-ranging psychosocial factors, and real-time patient observations to inform diagnosis, treatment, and referral decisions. Patient outcomes therefore depend on the reliable flow of information through networks of clinical staff and information systems. This study aimed to develop a quantitative data-driven research framework for the analysis of information flow in emergency healthcare settings to evaluate clinical practice and operational models for emergency psychiatric care.
Methods and findings
We deployed 2 observers in a tertiary hospital emergency department during 2018 for a total of 118.5 h to record clinical interactions along patient trajectories for presentations with risk of self-harm or suicide (n = 272 interactions for n = 43 patient trajectories). The study population was reflective of a naturalistic sample of patients presenting to a tertiary emergency department in a metropolitan Australian city. Using the observational data, we constructed a clinical interaction network to model the flow of clinical information at a systems level. Community detection via modularity maximization revealed communities in the network closely aligned with the underlying clinical team structure.

Reservoir computing with higher-order interactive coupled pendulums,Physical Review E,"The reservoir computing approach utilizes a time series of measurements as input to a high-dimensional dynamical system known as a reservoir. However, the approach relies on sampling a random matrix to define its underlying reservoir layer, which leads to numerous hyperparameters that need to be optimized. Here, we propose a nonlocally coupled pendulum model with higher-order interactions as a novel reservoir, which requires no random underlying matrices and fewer hyperparameters. We use Bayesian optimization to explore the hyperparameter space within a minimal number of iterations and train the coupled pendulums model to reproduce the chaotic attractors, which simplifies complicated hyperparameter optimization.

In this situation, temporal and spatial characteristics of each moving oscillator are in excellent agreement with that of their learned dynamical system under consideration. Remarkably, we show that these reservoir computing oscillators can exhibit significantly distinct collective behaviors that resemble bifurcation phenomenon when changing a critical reservoir parameter.

Network representations of attractors for change point detection,Communications Physics,"A common approach to monitoring the status of physical and biological systems is through the regular measurement of various system parameters. Changes in a system’s underlying dynamics manifest as changes in the behaviour of the observed time series. For example, the transition from healthy cardiac activity to ventricular fibrillation results in erratic dynamics in measured electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Identifying these transitions—change point detection—can be valuable in preparing responses to mitigate the effects of undesirable system changes. Here, we present a data-driven method of detecting change points using a phase space approach. Delay embedded trajectories are used to construct an ‘attractor network’, a discrete Markov-chain representation of the system’s attractor. Once constructed, the attractor network is used to assess the level of surprise of future observations where unusual …",23993650,5.311

However, applying these models in real systems is difficult as prior information of the connectivity structure or local dynamics is often unknown and must be inferred from node state observations. Additionally, the influence of coupling interactions complicates the isolation of local node dynamics. Given the architectural similarities between dynamical networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we propose a network inference method based on the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm used to train RNNs.

An approximation of local node dynamics is first constructed using a neural network. This is …",23274697,6.997
A Network Data Analytics Approach to Assessing Reservoir Uncertainty and Identification of Characteristic Reservoir Models,SPE Asia Pacific Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition,"One of the challenges faced by companies in the oil and gas industry is the difficulty in assessing and quantifying subsurface uncertainties when planning for hydrocarbon exploitation. A commonly employed approach is to use available exploration and appraisal data to produce a range of possible subsurface realisations, through which hydrocarbon production forecasts are generated. Prediction of hydrocarbon production from these simulations are then used to assess the viability of a planned development concept and the associated subsurface uncertainties. However, due to the sparsity of field data and unpredictability of underground geology coupled with the typically large dataset sizes, the ability to rapidly quantify prediction uncertainty and provide an overview of the range of underground geologies leaves much to be desired.

Fitness-driven deactivation in network evolution,Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment,"Individual nodes in evolving real-world networks typically experience growth and decay—that is, the popularity and influence of individuals peaks and then fades. In this paper, we study this phenomenon via an intrinsic nodal fitness function and an intuitive ageing mechanism. Each node of the network is endowed with a fitness which represents its activity. All the nodes have two discrete stages: active and inactive. The evolution of the network combines the addition of new active nodes randomly connected to existing active ones and the deactivation of old active nodes with a possibility inversely proportional to their fitnesses. We obtain a structured exponential network when the fitness distribution of the individuals is homogeneous and a structured scale-free network with heterogeneous fitness distributions. Furthermore, we recover two universal scaling laws of the clustering coefficient for both cases, C (k)∼ k− 1 …",17425468,1.415
Estimating the distribution of dynamic invariants: Illustrated with an application to human photo-plethysmographic time series,Nonlinear Sciences,"Dynamic invariants are often estimated from experimental time series with the aim of differentiating between different physical states in the underlying system. The most popular schemes for estimating dynamic invariants are capable of estimating confidence intervals, owever, such confidence intervals do not reflect variability in the underlying dynamics. We propose a surrogate based method to estimate the expected distribution of values under the null hypothesis that the underlying deterministic dynamics are stationary. We demonstrate the application of this method by considering four recordings of human pulse waveforms in differing physiological states and show that correlation dimension and entropy are insufficient to differentiate between these states. In contrast, algorithmic complexity can clearly differentiate between all four rhythms.","15651339, 21910294",1.514

Following in the footsteps of adaptive voter models, further research has considered BCMs in the setting where agents are able to dynamically adjust their edges, which subsequently feedback into the opinion dynamics of the network. Several methods of updating connections have been proposed ranging from random rewiring to more sophisticated approaches based on concordant edges, homophily and cognitive dissonance.

Modeling Ordinal First Return Dynamics from Time Series,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,"We examine the family of ordinal First Return Maps (FRMs) of a dynamical system time series to model the system’s dynamics. We consider two distinct modeling approaches using the same modeling method and compare their outcomes to ascertain the prerequisites for each to function and which approach is more effective in different circumstances. The first approach involves short-term modeling of the entire flow, followed by identifying the ordinal sections on the predicted flow.

Parameter estimation for Gipps’ car following model in a Bayesian framework,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,"Car following model is an important part in traffic modelling and has attracted a lot of attentions in the literature. As the proposed car following models become more complex with more components, reliably estimating their parameters becomes crucial to enhance model predictive performance. While most studies adopt an optimisation-based approach for parameters estimation, we present a statistically rigorous method that quantifies uncertainty of the estimates. We present a Bayesian approach to estimate parameters using the popular Gipps’ car following model as demonstration, which allows proper uncertainty quantification and propagation. Since the parameters of the car following model enter the statistical model through the solution of a delay-differential equation, the posterior is analytically intractable so we implemented an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from it.

Growing local likelihood network: Emergence of communities,Europhysics Letters,"In many real situations, networks grow only via local interactions. New nodes are added to the growing network with information only pertaining to a small subset of existing nodes. Multilevel marketing, social networks, and disease models can all be depicted as growing networks based on local (network path-length) distance information. In these examples, all nodes whose distance from a chosen center is less than d form a subgraph. Hence, we grow networks with information only from these subgraphs. Moreover, we use a likelihood-based method, where at each step we modify the networks by changing their likelihood to be closer to the expected degree distribution. Combining the local information and the likelihood method, we grow networks that exhibit novel features.

A nonlinear dynamical systems modelling approach unveils chaotic dynamics in simulations of large strain behaviour of a granular material under biaxial compression,AIP Conference Proceedings,We consider bulk measurements of shear stress in a discrete element simulation of biaxial compression of a densely packed granular assembly in the failure regime in the presence of a single persistent shear band.

Control of layer 5 pyramidal cell spiking by oscillatory,Journal of Neuroscience,"METHODS
Modeling of layer 5 pyramidal cells. Simulations were performed using NEURON version 7.0 (Hines and Carnevale 1997).

Manipulation of Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) by Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (Tospovirus) Via the Host Plant Nutrients to Enhance Its …,Environmental Entomology,"Earlier studies have shown that Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) influences the biology, performance, and behavioral patterns of its vector Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande. In this study, using Capsicum annuum L. as the host plant, we aimed to determine the manipulation of F. occidentalis by TSWV through switching of the diet (+ or −TSWV) during vector’s development. Behavioral patterns, fitness, as well as vector performance were evaluated. The specific parameters investigated included longevity/survival, fecundity, development time, feeding, and preferential behavior. F. occidentalis were reared on either TSWV-infected (exposed) or healthy leaves (non-exposed) throughout their larval stages. The emerging adults were then individually transferred to either healthy or TSWV-infected leaf disks. This resulted into four treatments, consisting of exposed or non-exposed thrips reared on either infected or …","0046225X, 19382936",1.883
"Predictive Models for Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus Spread Dynamics, Considering Frankliniella occidentalis Specific Life Processes as Influenced by the Virus",PloS one,"Several models have been studied on predictive epidemics of arthropod vectored plant viruses in an attempt to bring understanding to the complex but specific relationship between the three cornered pathosystem (virus, vector and host plant), as well as their interactions with the environment. A large body of studies mainly focuses on weather based models as management tool for monitoring pests and diseases, with very few incorporating the contribution of vector’s life processes in the disease dynamics, which is an essential aspect when mitigating virus incidences in a crop stand. In this study, we hypothesized that the multiplication and spread of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) in a crop stand is strongly related to its influences on Frankliniella occidentalis preferential behavior and life expectancy. Model dynamics of important aspects in disease development within TSWV-F. occidentalis-host plant interactions were developed, focusing on F. occidentalis’ life processes as influenced by TSWV. The results show that the influence of TSWV on F. occidentalis preferential behaviour leads to an estimated increase in relative acquisition rate of the virus, and up to 33% increase in transmission rate to healthy plants. Also, increased life expectancy; which relates to improved fitness, is dependent on the virus induced preferential behaviour, consequently promoting multiplication and spread of the virus in a crop stand. The development of vector–based models could further help in elucidating the role of tri-trophic interactions in agricultural disease systems. Use of the model to examine the components of the disease process could also boost our …",19326203,3.107
Parameter identification in a tuberculosis model for Cameroon,PloS one,"A deterministic model of tuberculosis in Cameroon is designed and analyzed with respect to its transmission dynamics. The model includes lack of access to treatment and weak diagnosis capacity as well as both frequency- and density-dependent transmissions. It is shown that the model is mathematically well-posed and epidemiologically reasonable. Solutions are non-negative and bounded whenever the initial values are non-negative. A sensitivity analysis of model parameters is performed and the most sensitive ones are identified by means of a state-of-the-art Gauss-Newton method. In particular, parameters representing the proportion of individuals having access to medical facilities are seen to have a large impact on the dynamics of the disease. The model predicts that a gradual increase of these parameters could significantly reduce the disease burden on the population within the next 15 years.",19326203,3.107
Environmental triggers for photosynthetic protein turnover determine the optimal nitrogen distribution and partitioning in the canopy,Journal of experimental botany,"Plants continually adjust the photosynthetic functions in their leaves to fluctuating light, thereby optimizing the use of photosynthetic nitrogen (Nph) at the canopy level. To investigate the complex interplay between external signals during the acclimation processes, a mechanistic model based on the concept of protein turnover (synthesis and degradation) was proposed and parameterized using cucumber grown under nine combinations of nitrogen and light in growth chambers. Integrating this dynamic model into a multi-layer canopy model provided accurate predictions of photosynthetic acclimation of greenhouse cucumber canopies grown under high and low nitrogen supply in combination with day-to-day fluctuations in light at two different levels. This allowed us to quantify the degree of optimality in canopy nitrogen use for maximizing canopy carbon assimilation, which was influenced by Nph distribution …","00220957, 14602431",5.81
Physiological and morphological responses of cassava genotypes to fertilization regimes in chromi-haplic acrisols soils,Agronomy,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the performances of three cassava genotypes on yield, physiology and morphological traits under different fertilization regimes. A field experiment was conducted in a split-plot design for two consecutive seasons in the Mansa district of the Luapula Province of Northern Zambia in the highly weathered Chromi-haplic Acrisol soils. Four fertilization regimes, control-M3, lime-M1, NPK fertilizer-M4 and NPK fertilizer + lime-M2 were the main plots, while three varieties (Mweru-V1, Bangweulu-V2 and Katobamputa (local)-V3) were subplots. Periodic measurements of leaf area index, light interception, yield and yield components from 75 days after planting (DAP) up to 410 DAP and daily weather measurements of data were recorded. Fertilization significantly increased the radiation use efficiency (RUE) and light extinction coefficient (K) in two seasons compared to the control. Significant fertilization regimes and varietal effects were observed for seasonal LAI, stem yield, root yield, biomass, harvest index (HI), tuber number, root diameter, plant height and SPAD (chlorophyll index). A significant year’s effects on root yield, yield components and physiological performances were observed while significant fertilization × variety interaction was observed on seasonal LAI, tuber number, root diameter, plant height and SPAD. Significant fertilization × year interaction effects were observed on root yield, yield components and physiological performances.

A modeling approach to quantify the effects of stomatal behavior and mesophyll conductance on leaf water use efficiency,Frontiers in plant science,"Water use efficiency (WUE) is considered as a determinant of yield under stress and a component of crop drought resistance. Stomatal behavior regulates both transpiration rate and net assimilation and has been suggested to be crucial for improving crop WUE. In this work, a dynamic model was used to examine the impact of dynamic properties of stomata on WUE. The model includes sub-models of stomatal conductance dynamics, solute accumulation in the mesophyll, mesophyll water content, and water flow to the mesophyll. Using the instantaneous value of stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and transpiration rate were simulated using a biochemical model and Penman-Monteith equation, respectively. The model was parameterized for a cucumber leaf and model outputs were evaluated using climatic data. Our simulations revealed that WUE was higher on a cloudy than a sunny day. Fast stomatal reaction to light decreased WUE during the period of increasing light (e.g., in the morning) by up to 10.2% and increased WUE during the period of decreasing light (afternoon) by up to 6.25%. Sensitivity of daily WUE to stomatal parameters and mesophyll conductance to CO2 was tested for sunny and cloudy days. Increasing mesophyll conductance to CO2 was more likely to increase WUE for all climatic conditions (up to 5.5% on the sunny day) than modifications of stomatal reaction speed to light and maximum stomatal conductance.",1664462X,4.239
Cropping practices and effects on soil nutrient adequacy levels and cassava yield of smallholder farmers in Northern Zambia,International Journal of Agronomy,"Cassava is a staple food and a major source of income for many smallholder farmers. However, its yields are less than 6 t ha−1 compared to a potential yield of 20–25 t ha−1 in Zambia. Understanding cropping practices and constraints in cassava production systems is imperative for sustainable intensification. Therefore, a survey of 40 households each with three fields of cassava at 12, 24, and 36 months after planting (MAP) was conducted. Analyzed soil data, leaf area index (LAI), intercepted photosynthetically active radiation, and management practices from 120 fields were collected and subjected to descriptive statistics. To explain yield differences within the same cassava growth stage group, the data were grouped into low‐ and high‐yield categories using the median, before applying a nonparametric test for one independent sample.

Physiological and morphological responses of different spring barley genotypes to water deficit and associated QTLs,PloS one,"Water deficit is one of the major limitations to food production worldwide and most climate change scenarios predict an aggravation of the situation. To face the expected increase in drought stress in the coming years, breeders are working to elucidate the genetic control of barley growth and productivity traits under water deficit. Barley is known as a relatively drought tolerant crop and genetic variability was observed for drought tolerance traits. The objectives of the present study were the quantification of morphological and physiological responses in a collection of 209 spring barley genotypes to drought stress, and the genetic analysis by genome-wide association study to find quantitative trait loci (QTL) and the allele contributions for each of the investigated traits. In six pot experiments, 209 spring barley genotypes were grown under a well-watered and water-limited regime. Stress phases were initiated individually for each genotype at the beginning of tillering and spiking for the vegetative- and the generative stage experiments, respectively, and terminated when the transpiration rates of stress treatments reached 10% of the well-watered control. After the stress phase, a total of 42 productivity related traits such as the dry matter of plant organs, tiller number, leaf length, leaf area, amount of water soluble carbohydrates in the stems, proline content in leaves and osmotic adjustment of corresponding well-watered and stressed plants were analysed, and QTL analyses were performed to find marker-trait associations.

It is grown in legume intercropping with little or no fertilizer, causing nutrient depletion with consequent land abandonment. Therefore, the study objective was to investigate the performance of cassava under lime, fertilizer, and grain legume intercropping on exhausted land in Northern Zambia. A split‐split plot design experiment was conducted over two seasons, comprising two lime rates (0 and 300 kg ha−1), two fertilizer rates (0 and 100N : 23P:80 K kg ha−1), and three grain legumes (common beans, cowpea, and soybean) intercropped in cassava and sole cassava arranged in RCBD with three replications.

"Interspecific variation in leaf traits, photosynthetic light response, and whole-plant productivity in amaranths (Amaranthus spp. L.)",Plos one,"Photosynthetic light response curve parameters help us understand the interspecific variation in photosynthetic traits, leaf acclimation status, carbon uptake, and plant productivity in specific environments. These parameters are also influenced by leaf traits which rely on species and growth environment. In accessions of four amaranth species (Amaranthus. hybridus, A. dubius, A. hypochondriacus, and A. cruentus), we determined variations in the net photosynthetic light response curves and leaf traits, and analysed the relationships between maximum gross photosynthetic rate, leaf traits, and whole-plant productivity. Non-rectangular hyperbolae were used for the net photosynthesis light response curves. Maximum gross photosynthetic rate (Pgmax) was the only variant parameter among the species, ranging from 22.29 to 34.21 μmol m–2 s–1. Interspecific variation existed for all the leaf traits except leaf mass per area and leaf inclination angle. Stomatal conductance, nitrogen, chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents, as well as leaf area correlated with Pgmax. Stomatal conductance and leaf nitrogen explained much of the variation in Pgmax at the leaf level. At the plant level, the slope between absolute growth rate and leaf area showed a strong linear relationship with Pgmax. Overall, A. hybridus and A. cruentus exhibited higher Pgmax at the leaf level and light use efficiency at the whole-plant level than A. dubius, and A. hypochondriacus. Thus, A. hybridus and A. cruentus tended to be more efficient with respect to carbon assimilation. These findings highlight the correlation between leaf photosynthetic characteristics, other leaf traits, and whole plant …",19326203,3.107
Experiments for in silico evaluation of Optimality of Photosynthetic Nitrogen Distribution and Partitioning in the Canopy: an Example Using Greenhouse Cucumber Plants,Bio-Protocol,"Acclimation of leaf traits to fluctuating environments is a key mechanism to maximize fitness. One of the most important strategies in acclimation to changing light is to maintain efficient utilization of nitrogen in the photosynthetic apparatus by continuous modifications of between-leaf distribution along the canopy depth and within-leaf partitioning between photosynthetic functions according to local light availability. Between-leaf nitrogen distribution has been intensively studied over the last three decades, where proportional coordination between nitrogen concentration and light gradient was considered optimal in terms of maximizing canopy photosynthesis, without taking other canopy structural and physiological factors into account.

"First Form, Then Function: 3D Reconstruction of Cucumber Plants (Cucumis sativus L.) Allows Early Detection of Stress Effects through Leaf Dimensions",Remote Sensing,"Detection of morphological stress symptoms through 3D examination of plants might be a cost-efficient way to avoid yield losses and ensure product quality in agricultural and horticultural production. Although the 3D reconstruction of plants was intensively performed, the relationships between morphological and physiological plant responses to salinity stress need to be established. Therefore, cucumber plants were grown in a greenhouse in nutrient solutions under three salinity treatments: 0, 25, and 50 mM NaCl. To detect stress-induced changes in leaf transversal and longitudinal angles and dimensions, photographs were taken from plants for 3D reconstruction through photogrammetry. For assessment of physiological stress responses, invasive leaf measurements, including the determination of leaf osmotic potential, leaf relative water content, and the leaf dry to fresh weight ratio, were performed. The transversal and longitudinal leaf dimensions revealed statistically significant differences between stressed and control plants after 60 °Cd (day 3) for the leaves which appeared before stress imposition. Strong correlations were found between the transversal width and some investigated physiological traits. Morphological changes were shown as indicators of physiological responses of leaves under salinity stress.",20724292,4.547
A cellular automata model for Chagas disease,Applied mathematical modelling,"Chagas disease is a major health concern in South and Central America.

From trmm to gpm: how reliable are satellite-based precipitation data across nigeria?,Remote Sensing,"In this study, 16 satellite-based precipitation products (SPPs) comprising satellite, gauge and reanalysis datasets were assessed on a monthly time step using precipitation data from 11 gauge stations across Nigeria within the 2000–2012 period as reference. Despite the ability of some of the SPPs to reproduce the salient north–south pattern of the annual rainfall field, the Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) results revealed substantial discrepancies among the SPP estimates. Generally, the SPP reliability varies spatially and temporally, with all SPPs performing better over part of central Nigeria during the dry season. When we compared the real-time and adjusted satellite-based products, the results showed that the adjusted products had a better KGE score. The assessment also showed that the reliability of integrated multi-satellite retrievals for Global Precipitation Mission (IMERG) products was consistent with that of their predecessor Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA). Finally, the best overall scores were obtained from multi-source weighted-ensemble precipitation (MSWEP) v.2.2 and IMERG-F v.6.

A cellular automaton model for the transmission of Chagas disease in heterogeneous landscape and host community,Applied Mathematical Modelling,"Chagas disease is a vector-borne disease and a major public health concern in Latin America. To understand the disease dynamics, we investigated the influence of landscape heterogeneity and host diversity on pathogen transmission. We developed an epidemiological model based on the cellular automata approach to simulate the spread of Chagas disease in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments with competent and noncompetent hosts species. We show at first that weak levels of dispersal are associated with a reduction in infection as vectors infected in habitats of high transmission tend to spread into habitats with fewer hosts. A second important conclusion is that larger levels of dispersal can have very contrasted effects depending on the composition of the host community in the area of lower intrinsic transmission.",0307904X,5.175

A graph theory approach for regional controllability of boolean cellular automata,"International Journal of Parallel, Emergent and Distributed Systems","Controllability is one of the central concepts of modern control theory that allows a good understanding of a system's behaviour. It consists in constraining a system to reach the desired state from an initial state within a given time interval. When the desired objective affects only a sub-region of the domain, the control is said to be regional. The purpose of this paper is to study a particular case of regional control using cellular automata models since they are spatially extended systems where spatial properties can be easily defined thanks to their intrinsic locality.

"Markov Chains Approach for Regional Controllability of Deterministic Cellular Automata, via Boundary Actions.",J. Cell.

This problem has already been studied for continuous systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). The concept of controllability was first identified by R. Kalman in 1960. In linear systems analysis the Kalman rank condition is omnipresent and was used to obtain the main characterization results on controllability. The purpose of this paper is to study this concept by means of Cellular Automata models considered as the counterpart of PDEs. We focus on regional controllability that considers objectives to be achieved only on a subregion of the whole domain and consider controls exerted on the boundary of the target region. We prove the regional controllability of two dimensional deterministic linear cellular automata by exploring a new approach based on Markov chains.

Its elements are, in fact, the transition (local) rules of the fuzzy cellular automata studied by previous authors.

Some control and observation issues in cellular automata,Complex Systems,"This review article focuses on studying problems of observability and controllability of cellular automata (CAs) considered in the context of control theory, an important feature of which is the adoption of a state-space model. Our work first consists in generalizing the obtained results to systems described by CAs considered as the discrete counterpart of partial differential equations, and in exploring possible approaches to prove controllability and observability. After having introduced the notion of control and observation in cellular automata models, in a similar way to the case of discrete-time distributed parameter systems, we investigate these key concepts of control theory in the case of complex systems. For the controllability issue, the Boolean class is particularly studied and applied to the regional case, while the observability is approached in the general case and related to the reconstructibility problem for linear or nonlinear CAs.",08912513,0.465
A lattice Boltzmann model to study sedimentation phenomena in irrigation canals,Communications in Computational Physics,"Fresh water is one of the most significant resources for human activities and survival, and irrigation is among the most important uses of water. The sustainibility and performance of irrigation canals can be greatly affected by sediment transport and deposition. In our previous works, we proposed a Lattice Boltzmann model for simulating a free surface flow in an irrigation canal, as an alternative to more traditional models mainly based on shallow water equations. Here we introduce the sedimentation phenomenon into our model by adding a new algorithm, based on the earlier work by B. Chopard, A. Dupuis and A. Masselot [9,11,12,27]. Transport, erosion, deposition and toppling of sediments are taken into account and enable the global sedimentation algorithm to simulate different transport modes such as bed load and suspended load. In the present work, we study both the behaviour of a sediment deposit located …","18152406, 19917120",2.219
Observability and reconstructibility of bounded cellular automata,International Journal of Systems Science,"The aim of this article is to provide several ways to assess the observability and the reconstructibility of bounded cellular automata (CA). First, generic definitions for the considered CA and their associated sensors are given, as well as the definitions for observability and reconstructibility of these measured dynamical systems. Criteria of observability and reconstructibility are proposed for linear and affine CA through an extension of the Kalman criterion and for non-linear CA from an extension of the results on observability and reconstructibility of Boolean networks. A method for decentralised observability calculation is presented for non-linear CA in order to reduce the algorithmic complexity. These criteria are analyzed and illustrated through several examples, either with fixed or mobile sensors. Numerical methods and related complexity issues are discussed.","00207721, 14645319",5.595
Optimal and suboptimal regional control of probabilistic cellular automata,Natural Computing,"Probabilistic cellular automata are extended stochastic systems, widely used for modelling phenomena in many disciplines. The possibility of controlling their behaviour is therefore an important topic. We shall present here an approach to the problem of controlling such systems by acting only on the boundary of a target region.

Finally, we present an example of optimal control with avoidance.","15677818, 15729796",2.275
"Controlling the Dynamics of FCA Rule 90 in [0, 1]T.",Journal of Cellular Automata,"We consider one-dimensional Fuzzy Cellular Automata (FCA) defined as a real-valued version of elementary cellular automata (ECA) ie, the cells are identified with the real values in [0, 1] rather than the binary ones. We analyse possible ways of controlling the FCA dynamics in order to find a signal u=(u0, u1,..., uT− 1) which forces the system to reach at a horizon time T> 0, some particular target states starting from a specific initial condition. The control components ui, i= 0,..., T− 1 which excite the system at time i are also taken in [0, 1]. The admissible controls are then to be found in [0, 1] T. This case is conceptually more difficult than our previous work dedicated to solve the same control problem in RT. We investigate the particular FCA rule 90 in the case of a single seed on a zero background. We prove the existence of such a control for small values of T and show that generically, the larger the value of T the “smaller” the set of admissible controls.","15575969, 15575977",0.143

"Shoreline evolution: GIS, remote sensing and cellular automata modelling",Natural Computing,"The evolution and more particularly the erosion of the coasts morphology is an important environmental subject. Both the study of the actual evolution of coasts via digital tools and their modelling for the sake of prediction are necessary. A study of the evolution of a section of the Algerian coastline with a geographical information system shows that erosion is the main factor for the shoreline evolution, in the absence of structures consolidating the beaches. Therefore, a qualitative numerical model of the erosion of a coastline is proposed. It relies on a coupling between a cellular automata sedimentation model and a bi-fluid hydrodynamical model based on the Lattice Boltzmann method. The current model is two-dimensional and simulates a cross-section of a virtual coastline. The virtual coastline exhibits a gradual erosion by the water, whose speed depends on the kind of perturbation applied on the water level.","15677818, 15729796",2.275

Computational Method to Quantify the Evolution of Ocean Properties,International Journal of Computer Applications,"Understanding the recent trends in observable changes of the ocean physical and chemical properties is of great importance in order to foresee their future evolution and to quantify the probable contribution of anthropogenic pressure to these changes. For that matter, it is necessary to consider new methods and concepts for the analysis and modelling of ocean properties. In this paper, we introduce an original set of computational tools to process data measurements in order to study the evolution of some ocean properties. The method will be utilized to thoroughly analyze the evolution of an ocean property through a given period of time and in a whole water column by comparing its values at a given space/time coordinate to a well-defined reference value. Results will be exploited to emphasize the so-called spreadability phenomenon. Some insight will be given on the spreadability concept, based on systems theory.

"Chaos, synchronization and control in cellular automata","ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA. B, PROCEEDINGS SUPPLEMENT","Control theory is a set of techniques for making a dynamical system behave in a desired way by exerting an external effort. In the case of a minimum effort one speaks of optimal control. It is obviously hard to reach the optimum limit, but many investigations are devoted to minimize the control for a desired behaviour. Let us suppose that we have a system following a discrete-time dynamical evolution x (t+ 1)= f (x (t)), that we write synthetically as x= f (x). We want to add a (small) control u= u (t) such that, after a certain time interval, the trajectory x (t), now evolving as x= f (x)+ u, follows a trajectory y (t). In general, the problem of control of a dynamical system may be split into two parts. We have to bring the system x sufficiently near to some part of the trajectory y (t), and then stabilize the trajectory x (t) such that the distance| x (t)− y (t)| is below a certain threshold.",18992358,0.203

Computational universality of fungal sandpile automata,Physics Letters A,"Hyphae within the mycelia of the ascomycetous fungi are compartmentalised by septa. Each septum has a pore that allows for inter-compartmental and inter-hyphal streaming of cytosol and even organelles. The compartments, however, have special organelles, Woronin bodies, that can plug the pores. When the pores are blocked, no flow of cytoplasm takes place. Inspired by the controllable compartmentalisation within the mycelium of the ascomycetous fungi we designed two-dimensional fungal automata. A fungal automaton is a cellular automaton where communication between neighbouring cells can be blocked on demand. We demonstrate computational universality of the fungal automata by implementing sandpile cellular automata circuits there.

Emergence of density dynamics by surface interpolation in elementary cellular automata,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,"A classic problem in elementary cellular automata (ECAs) is the specification of numerical tools to represent and study their dynamical behaviour.

This paper introduces the modification of mean-field theory applied to cellular automata, using random perturbations based on the system’s evolution rule. The original aspect of this approach is that the perturbation factor is tailored to the nature of the rule, altering the behavior of the mean-field polynomials. By combining the properties of both the original and perturbed polynomials, it is possible to detect when a cellular automaton is more likely to generate gliders without having to run evolutions of the system. This methodology is a useful approach to finding more examples of cellular automata that exhibit complex behavior.

According to the results of the experiments, the detection accuracy of the machine learning methods reaches up to 99.9%, and their processing time has been reduced considerably by applying them in a parallel and distributed way, which proves that our proposed model is very effective for the detection of new hidden intrusions.","20894872, 22528938",2.509

Discrimination between demagnetization and eccentricity faults in PMSMs using real and imaginary components of stator current spectral analysis,Journal of Power Electronics,"Permanent magnet demagnetization and rotor eccentricity are the main faults in permanents magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). To detect these faults, motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has become the most common method in the field due to its simplicity, low computation time, and remote monitoring capability. Unfortunately, this method has a major drawback relating to the frequency signatures of demagnetization and eccentricity faults, which appear in the same frequency locations. To avoid this drawback while retaining the main advantages of the MCSA method, this paper proposes a new approach for discrimination between demagnetization and eccentricity faults in PMSMs. The proposed approach is based on the simultaneous monitoring of the real and imaginary components of the characteristic harmonics of these faults, which are obtained from stator current spectral analysis.

A highly scalable CF recommendation system using ontology and SVD-based incremental approach,Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics,"In recent years, the need of recommender systems has increased to enhance user engagement, provide personalized services, and increase revenue, especially in the online shopping industry where vast amounts of customer data are generated. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely used and effective approach for generating appropriate recommendations. However, the current CF approach has limitations in addressing common recommendation problems such as data inaccuracy recommendations, sparsity, scalability, and significant errors in prediction. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid CF method for movie recommendations that combines the incremental singular value decomposition approach with an item-based ontological semantic filtering approach in two phases, online and offline. The ontology-based technique is leveraged to enhance the accuracy of predictions and recommendations. Evaluating our method on a real-world movie recommendation dataset using precision, F1 scores, and mean absolute error (MAE) demonstrates that our system generates accurate predictions while addressing sparsity and scalability issues in recommendation system.

Decision based Cognitive Learning using Strategic Game Theory,Indian Journal of Science and Technology,"Objective
To modernize a system that can bring its own decision independently.
Methodology
In this paper, we are projecting a novel model of the cognitive learning process using similar to the human learning technique.
Findings
We have proved here that the relationship between two individuals may change their judgment in the same surroundings. Many researchers and scientists are working together over than six decades to develop an intelligence system as a human. Decision making is not so elementary. Each and every decision depends upon prior knowledge and decisions. With a slight change in nature may change the decision from pros to cons, from good to bad. In such a dynamic environment, we need to develop some dynamic system that can change the decision accordingly to the environment. Game theory plays an important role to handle such dynamic decision making in this world. We make decisions and learn through the observations and experience and then store the observed or concluded results into our knowledge base. Learning makes us more powerful to produce a sound determination. Rule based systems define the relationship between a person to another, then that decision does efficiently and consequently to the kinship.
Application
This paper introduces a new version of thinking capability of machine in dynamic nature using game theory. We trust that this paper will require a revolution in sound system design and clay sculpture.","09745645, 09746846",0.0

Adjectival phrases as the sentiment carriers in the Urdu text,Journal of American Science,"In this paper we present a comprehensive overview of the structures of the adjectival phrases in the Urdu language with respect to the task of sentiment analysis. Urdu is a widely spoken but one of the least explored languages by the computational linguistics community. After a detailed analysis of adjectival phrases in Urdu text we conclude that this language is orthographically, morphologically and grammatically different from other well established languages, like English and hence, it requires updated or different approaches and algorithms for the task of sentiment analysis. We present our approach in which the adjectival phrases are combined with polarity shifters, and conjunctions to make sentiment expressions in the opinionated sentences. We label these sentiment expressions as the SentiUnits. We apply shallow parsing based chunking to extract the SentiUnits. The overall polarity of a sentence in a given review can be determined by computing the polarity of these expressions. Adjectives are the head words, which appear with modifiers and postpositions.

Potential and actual collaboration support for distributed Pair-Programming,Computación y sistemas,"In Pair Programming–a software development technique that is part of Extreme Programming (XP)–two developers work side by side, on a single computer, to jointly produce an artifact. It has been reported that Pair Programming can be accounted for the development of higher quality software in half the time it required a single programmer. Pair programmers are meant to be collocated since they require continuous and fluid communication. However, the globalization of the software industry and the growth of open source software development are trends that motivate the need to support Distributed Pair Programming. For distributed pair programming to be effective, its support should facilitate not only actually collaborating in pairs, but also the pairing of distributed colleagues in an opportunistic and flexible manner.

SAFRank: multi-agent based approach for internet services selection.,Int. Arab J. Inf. Technol.,"In the era of modern world, organization are preferring to adopt smart solutions for their business tasks and managing huge and complex transactions. These solutions are provided through online application infrastructures of Internet of Things (IoT), cloud, fog, and edge computing. In the presence of numerous prospects, the selection benchmark for such offers becomes vibrant, especially, when there is no supportive platform available. Prevailing approaches provide services by evaluating the quality of service parameters, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifications, k-mean clustering, assigning scores, trustworthiness and fuzzy logic techniques on customer's feedback. However, these approaches classically depend on seeker’feedback and do ‘not consider interrelationship between the services. Secondly, these techniques do not follow standards derived by well-known organizations like National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), International Organization for Standards (ISO), and IEEE. Feedback may be self-generated or biased and leading to inappropriate recommendation to end users. To resolve the issue, we propose multi agent based approach using service association factor that computes interrelationship values among services appearing together in a package as SAFRank and evaluates it on standards along with dynamically defined quality of service parameters. It assists seekers to select the best services on their preferences from pool of IoT and internet services. The technique is tested on leading cloud vendors and results show that it meets the desires of service seekers in all service models in an efficient manner.","16833198, 23094524",2.264

Multi-class confidence detection using deep learning approach,Applied Sciences,"The advancement of both the fields of Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has enabled the development of effective automatic systems for analyzing human behavior. It is possible to recognize gestures, which are frequently used by people to communicate information non-verbally, by studying hand movements. So, the main contribution of this research is the collected dataset, which is taken from open-source videos of the relevant subjects that contain actions that depict confidence levels. The dataset contains high-quality frames with minimal bias and less noise. Secondly, we have chosen the domain of confidence determination during social issues such as interviews, discussions, or criminal investigations. Thirdly, the proposed model is a combination of two high-performing models, i.e., CNN (GoogLeNet) and LSTM. GoogLeNet is the state-of-the-art architecture for hand detection and gesture recognition. LSTM prevents the loss of information by keeping temporal data. So the combination of these two outperformed during the training and testing process.

A User-Centered Approach for Cloud Service Selection and Recommendation.,Res. Comput. Sci.,"Cloud computing is one of the most emerging industries and offers scalable computing resources and on-demand packages. A large number of cloud services are being offered by many service providers, a vendor supplies many services or same service is provided by many vendors, which creates the selection issue of appropriate cloud service from a big pool. Quality of service plays important role for better service choice. For this reason, cloud service recommendation systems are proposed in the literature that makes it easy for a user to decide which service to choose. However, user needs and requirements like economy, feedback, etc. are least considered, In our approach, an efficient cloud service recommendation system has been developed enabling users to hire a cloud service according to their own requirements. The aim is to test services according to user needs and some stated parameters. Users select the criteria from given parameter repository, the quality attributes like security, privacy, data storage, etc. and thus services are evaluated.

An Expertise Recommender System for Web Cooperative Production,Journal of American Science,"This paper focuses on providing dedicated expertise recommender system to enhance awareness among group members, working in a distributed cooperative environment. Normally, coauthors lack the information about the production capabilities of their colleagues. As a result of this lack, when they need assistance for the production of complex objects (formulae, figures, style sheets, etc.) they ask their colleagues for help, consequently the authoring process is disturbed. On the other hand, personal referrals may not be useful due to human biasing, liking, and disliking. The existing expertise recommender systems work on user profiles containing user qualification, experience, and history of solved problems. These systems require manual database updation which can be performed by only skilled person. We treat the issue by developing an expertise recommender system which is incharge to seamlessly observe user activities and to auto detect a possible human expert of elaborated productions on the basis of a generic criterion. Whenever, a participant is deduced as a novice having some production problem, the developed system recommends him/her the presence of an expert with whom the novice can communicate. The entire goal is to enhance awareness coordination among collaborator activities and hence to generate a consistent shared production.[Journal of American Science 2010; 6 (7): 106-112].(ISSN: 1545-1003).","00925853, 15405907",6.293

The work combines the instrumentation techniques with knowledge based system. Agriculturalists frequently visit their farms to monitor the condition of plants and crop. This monitoring is time consuming. Conventional farms monitoring techniques and inspections give low crop production, attack of severe diseases parasites. Adequate amount of water, fertilizers, and nutrients can improve the yield and at the same time reduces the cost. In order to assist farmers and landowner, we designed and developed an agent based crop monitoring system. The objective of this research is to develop an agent based system to help the agriculturists to monitor the crops remotely by using recent technology and hence advise the farmers to take appropriate measures. The system is divided into main two main parts. First one is data acquisition and the other one is recommendation part. The readings of crucial environmental parameters are taken and sent to a central computer service. Color processing techniques are used to find the nitrogen deficiency in the green plants. Manual leaf color chart has been replaced by electronic one which is capable of providing sufficient information about future scenario of nitrogen content in the plants. The system uses real time information and recommends an appropriate solution of the problem caused by environmental stresses. In case of any critical situation, the system generates warnings in the form of an email, to be sent to the landowners or agriculturist.","00220000, 10902724",1.767

Mapping vesicle dynamics onto that of a rigid sphere in five dimensions,Physical Review E,"Vesicles are sacs made of a phospholipid bilayer, and they mimic the cytoplasmic membrane of real cells, for which red blood cells constitute a canonical example. Vesicles deform under flow, such as a shear flow. Under a linear shear flow, they are known to exhibit several motions that combine orientation and shape deformation (such as tank treading, vacillating breathing, and so on). It is shown here that the equations of motion of a vesicle under shear flow in the weak deformation regime can be mapped onto those of a loaded (or heavy bottom) rigid sphere in five dimensions in fictitious gravitational and shear fields. Based on our previous exact analytical solutions for vesicles (which we extend here to out-of-shear-plane motions), we provide hitherto unrevealed exact explicit solution for the rigid sphere problem.

Assimilation of the soil resistance to evaporation in ICARE,International Journal of Mathematics and Statistics,"In recent years, understanding and quantifying the global hydrologic cycle has become a priority research topic. Hydrologists now face the challenge to apply true data assimilation techniques to all problems where remote sensing data can provide new insights. However, this is a difficult task due to the highly nonlinear nature of land-surface processes, the size of the problem, and the lack of data and experience to determine error statistics accurately. Consequently, the implementation of data assimilation techniques always requires trade-offs between resolution, complexity, computational effort, and data availability. Our approach is based in variational data assimilation. All control theory or variational assimilation approaches perform a global time-space adjustment of the model solution to all observations and thus solve a smoothing problem.

The numerical simulations based on Level-Set method show that the coupling between the membrane and the molecules makes the membrane suffer from morphological instability.","12236934, 22469958",0.438

Multi-objective generalised sensitivity analysis to TSEB model applied at irrigated olive orchard in semi-arid area,International Journal of Computational Science and Engineering,"The results of the two source energy balance model (TSEB) (Norman et al., 1995) are strongly dependent on most influencing parameters and also its adjustment. The present study is focused on multi-objective generalised sensitivity analysis (MOGSA) approach to identify the most sensitive parameters on TSEB outputs, in order to conduct their calibration thereafter to improve the performance of TSEB model. As expected, and conformably to previous studies, the results show that the changing of some soil and vegetation parameters has a significant influence on TSEB outputs. These results were found to be conforming to in situ semi-arid environments, thereby vegetation parameters have the most sensitive influence, and thus adequate attention to these can greatly enhance performance of TSEB, via calibration in order to report local environmental realism.","17427185, 17427193",1.992

Analysis of an epitaxial growth model without slope selection using a DC Algorithm,Nature Materials,"The main idea of our method is to rewrite the energy as a DC (difference of convex functions) programming problem.

Comparison of Neural Network Parameters for Classification of Arabic Handwritten Isolated Characters,International Journal of Computer Applications,"The neural network is a static classifier that requires fixedsize vector functions.

The main difficulty is to find the most appropriate combination of network architecture, learning function, transfer and training for the classification task. In this paper we dress the recognition of Arabic handwriting isolated characters using two types of neural networks: a feed forward and a cascade forward.

Roadmap for an Arabic Controlled Language,International Journal of Information Technology,"Controlled Natural Languages or CNLs are artificial subsets of natural languages that aim to make communication clearer and more precise. In general, CNLs are used in communication between humans or with computers and, particularly, when clarity and unambiguity are required. Existing CNLs have been developed to be exploited in many applications such as technical documentation, machine translation or database query language. So far, many CNLs have been developed for Western languages, especially English, but no concrete CNL has yet been proposed for Arabic even with the increasing number of Arabic Internet users in the last two decades. In this paper, we propose a roadmap for developing an Arabic CNL to provide new kind and advanced natural language services for Arabic people. Methodologically speaking, we review the most important existing CNLs in English and other languages helping us knowing some statistics related to the vocabulary size and the number of grammar rules that could help in designing the new CNL.

TOWARDS A FULLY CLOUD-BASED PLATFORM FOR ARABIC NLP,Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology,"Cloud Computing is getting more and more debated in the IT industry today. Its evolution is leading the next generation of internet services. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on understanding, manipulating and generating human language by machines. Thus, the NLP is really at the interface between computer science and linguistics. It, therefore, concerns the ability of the machine to interact directly with humans. Arabic NLP is very poor compared to other languages such as English or German due to the complexity of this language and the lack of resources. In this work, we propose a new system for Arabic NLP based entirely on the Cloud. This system is based on two steps. It firstly uses a bridge between Arabic and other developed languages (English for occurrence) and then uses of the already developed features for that language. Hence those features apply not on the Arabic text but instead on the translated (the English) one. In some cases, the result needs to be in Arabic, in which case, we use the bridge another time to translate English result into Arabic. This can either be used in real NLP systems, such as Translation, IR, QA, Sentiment Analysis, or for validation or comparison purposes, especially for those who work in NLP and use other approaches. Experiments have been performed on a prototype we developed and the results obtained are satisfactory for this first version.","18173195, 19928645",0.756

However, when conducting a comprehensive review of existing literature, it was found that the relationship results in TAM were inconsistent between the studies given the diversity of predictive factors in the TAM along with cultural differences. Therefore, this study attempts to suffice this gap by assessing the interaction factors in TAM with the e-learning context of working adults. The results show that experience, enjoyment, and self-efficacy affected learners' perceived usefulness and ease of use, which in turn affected the satisfaction and intent of the behavior. Therefore, this study has provided insight into how learners shape their attitudes and intentions for e-learning.","18173195, 19928645",0.756

A HMM recognition of consonant-vowel syllables from lip contours: the Cued Speech case,Interspeech 2007-8th Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association,"Cued Speech (CS) is a manual code that complements lipreading to enhance speech perception from visual input. The phonetic translation of CS gestures needs to combine the manual CS information with information from the lips, taking into account the desynchronization delay (Attina et al. [1], Aboutabit et al. [2]) between these two flows of information. This paper focuses on HMM recognition of the lip flow for Consonant Vowel (CV) syllables in the French Cued Speech production context. The CV syllables are considered in term of viseme groups that are compatible with the CS system. The HMM modeling is based on parameters derived from both the inner and outer lip contours. The global recognition score of CV syllable reaches 80.3%. This study shows that the errors are mainly observed on consonant groups in the context of high and mid-high rounded vowels. In contrast, CV syllables for anterior non rounded vowels and for low and mid-low rounded vowels are well recognized (in average 87%).",-,153.0
Vowel classification from lips: the Cued Speech production case,Proceedings of ISSP,"Cued Speech (CS)(Cornett, 1967) is a visual communication system that uses handshapes placed in different positions near the face in combination with the natural speech lip-reading to enhance speech perception from visual input. In this system, the speaker moves his or her hand in close relation with speech (see Attina et al., 2004). Handshapes are designed to distinguish among consonants and hand positions among vowels. Due to the CS system, both hand and lip flows produced by the CS speaker carry a part of the phonetic information. This contribution focuses on the lip flow (lip parameters) and discusses lip-shape classification of vowels for each cued speech hand position. The lip parameters are extracted from the inner lip contour and still characterize the vowels in the context of CS production (see Aboutabit et al., 2006b). This paper will show how the distribution of lip parameters inside each group of CS hand positions allows vowel discrimination. A classification method based on Gaussian modeling is presented and results demonstrate a good performance of this classification (95, 03% as learning score and 89% as test score).",-,153.0
Illumination correction in a comparative analysis of feature selection for rear-view vehicle detection,International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing,"One of the most frequent infractions on the road is the act of a vehicle crossing to the wrong side of the road to pass another vehicle traveling in the same direction.

Reduced featured based projective integral for road cracks detection and classification,Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis,"Abstract
This paper presents an enhanced and robust approach to detect and classify pavement cracks from captured images. The approach was based on three stages: pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. In pre-processing, we carried out several algorithms to compensate the impact of quality distortions during image acquisition. Then, features are retrieved from projective integrals computed on edge images. These features fed machine learning algorithms to classify the type of crack that may appear in a pavement image. The obtained results proved the relevance of our reduced features. We achieved the best successful classification rate of 93.4% using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and an accuracy of 94.7% for crack detection.","10546618, 15556212",1.108

View-independent vehicle category classification system,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,"Vehicle category classification is important, but it is a challenging task, especially, when the vehicles are captured from a surveillance camera with different view angles. This paper aims to develop a view-independent vehicle category classification system. It proposes a two-phase system: one phase recognizes the view angles helping the second phase to recognize the vehicle category including bus, car, motorcycle, and truck. In each phase, several descriptors and Machine Learning techniques including traditional algorithms and Deep neural networks are employed. In particular, we used three descriptors: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradient), LBP (Local Binary Patterns) and Gabor filter with two classifiers SVM (Support Vector Machine) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor). And also, we used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, or ConvNet). Three experiments have been elaborated based on many datasets. The first experiment is dedicated to choosing the best approach for the recognition of views: rear or front. The second experiment aims to classify the vehicle categories based on each view. In the third experiment, we developed the overall system, the categories were classified independently of the view. Experimental results reveal that CNN gives the highest recognition accuracy of 94.29% in the first experiment, and HOG with SVM or k-NN gives the best results (99.58%, 99.17%) in the second experiment.

They are based on modifying the principle of the LBP method where a local neighbourhood is coded in binary by integrating a criterion of its homogeneity. In this work, we define this criterion as the ratio of the total variation in the whole image to the local variation of the neighbourhood. Thus, a new approach of edge detection is presented in two versions according to the way of calculating the differences in a neighbourhood. Experimental results on a …","18631703, 18631711",3.197
Characterization of Cued Speech Vowels from The inner LiP contour.,Interspeech 2006,"Cued Speech (CS) is a manual code that complements lip-reading to enhance speech perception from visual input. The phonetic translation of CS gestures needs to combine the manual CS information with information from the lips, taking into account the desynchronization delay (Attina et al. [1], Aboutabit et al. [2]) between these two flows of information. This paper focuses on the analysis of the lip flow for vowels in French Cued Speech. The vocalic lip targets are defined automatically at the instant of minimum velocity of the inner lip contour area parameter, constrained by the corresponding acoustic labeling. We discuss in particular the possibility of discriminating the vowels with geometric lip parameters using the values at the instant of vocalic targets when associated to a Cued Speech hand position.",-,153.0
Analysis and prediction of personality traits using a self-generated database of Moroccan instagram users: impact of gender on image content and quantity on prediction accuracy,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"The sharing of social media data has provided a significant amount of information about users. This has led to a growing interest in predicting user personality from social network data. Predicting user personality has potential applications in advertising and content recommendation systems, and can be a valuable source of insights for professionals seeking to understand and target their audiences on social media. This study focuses on the Instagram application and aims to extract and analyze the personality of Instagram users based on the content of their photos. Three categories of features are extracted from images: visual, emotional, and content. To describe users’ personalities, we used the Big Five model. One of the main contributions of this study is the creation of a comprehensive database that includes 316 Moroccan Instagram users. This database is the first of its kind to belong to Moroccan users. Additionally …","13807501, 15737721",4.532
Unsupervised VAD method based on short-time energy and spectral centroid in Arabic speech case,International Journal of Computer Applications in Technology,"Voice Activity Detection (VAD) distinguishes speech segments from noise or silence areas. An efficient and noise-robust VAD system can be widely used for emerging speech technologies such as wireless communication and speech recognition. In this paper, we propose two versions of an unsupervised Arabic VAD method based on the combination of the Short-Time Energy (STE) and the Spectral Centroid (SC) features for formulating a typical threshold to detect speech areas. The first version compares only the STE feature to the threshold (STE-VAD). In contrast, the second compares the SC vector and the threshold (SC-VAD). The two versions of our VAD method were tested on 770 sentences of the Arabphone corpus, which were recorded in clean and noisy environments and evaluated under different values of Signal-to-Noise-Ratio. The experiments demonstrated the robustness of the STE-VAD in terms of …",09528091,1.876

IGAEM: Improved Genetic Algorithm based Entity Matching,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"The presence of duplicate records is a major data quality concern in huge datasets. To detect duplicates, entity matching is used as an essential step of the data cleaning process to map records that refer to the same real-world entity. Most of proposed algorithms require labeled data in order to train a classifier. However, we cannot always obtain labeled data. In our paper we propose an unsupervised approach for entity matching problem using an improved version of genetic algorithm. We explain the main improvements added to genetic algorithm and the encoding strategy to encode partitions in the form of a chromosome. Different similarity functions are used to compute similarities between records. The obtained results prove that our proposition stands as a powerful approach in the entity matching field where it outperforms the traditional genetic algorithm based approach.","17426588, 17426596",0.563
Synonym reduction in a comparative study of clustering algorithms in text mining,International Conference on Information Technology and Communication Systems,"The growing use of smart phones, social networks and cloud computing has added a large amount of data. Studies predict that just under 4 trillion gigabytes of data will exist on earth. This has created a problem related to the processing of the data exchanged, which is rising exponentially and should be automatically treated. This paper presents a classical process of knowledge discovery databases for treating textual data. This process is divided into three parts: pre-processing, processing and post-processing. In order to improve the classical process, we propose to introduce synonyms reduction before the processing step. This introduction, based on dictionaries, reduces the size of documents.",-,153.0
Automatic recognition of French Cued Speech using multimodal fusion based on hidden Markov models,"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing","Cued Speech based on hidden Markov models (HMM) is presented. Cued Speech is a visual system which uses handshapes in different positions and in combination with lip-patterns of speech, and makes all the sounds of spoken language clearly understandable to deaf and hearing-impaired people. The aim of Cued Speech is to overcome the problems of lipreading and thus enable deaf children and adults to understand full spoken language. In automatic recognition of Cued Speech, lip shape and gesture recognition are required. In addition, the integration of the two modalities is of the greatest importance. In this study, lip shape component is fused with gestures components to realize Cued Speech recognition. Using concatenative feature fusion and multi-stream HMM decision fusion, vowel recognition and consonant recognition experiments have been conducted. For vowel recognition, an 87.6% vowel accuracy was obtained showing a 61.3% relative improvement compared to the sole use of lip shape parameters. In the case of consonant recognition, a 78.9% accuracy was obtained showing a 56% relative improvement compared with the use of lip shape only. In addition to vowel and consonant recognition, a complete phoneme recognition experiment using concatenated feature vectors and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) discrimination has been conducted showing a 74.4% phoneme accuracy. The obtained results were compared to the results obtained using the audio signal showing comparable accuracies. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches as far as Cued Speech recognition is concerned.","15587916, 15587924",0.0

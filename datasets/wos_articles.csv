Reducing the interprocessors migrations of the ekg algorithm," real time scheduling , ekg , semi-partitioning real time scheduling , inter processor migrations","In this work, we consider the scheduling problem of a set of periodic implicit-deadline and synchronous tasks, on a real-time multiprocessor composed of m identical processors. it is known that the cost of migrations and preemptions has significant influence on global system performances. the ekg algorithm can generate a great number of migrant tasks, but it has the advantage that each migrant task migrates between two processors only. later, the edhs algorithm has been proposed in order to minimize the number of migrant tasks of ekg. although edhs minimizes the number of migration compared to ekg, its drawback is the generation of additional preemptions caused by the migrations on several processors. in this paper we propose a new tasks allocation algorithm that aims to combine the advantages of ekg (migrations between two processors only) and those of edhs (reduction of number of migrations).",18951767,Scalable computing-practice and experience,0.308

Pollution impact study in gabes gulf (tunisia) using remote-sensing data,,"A multidisciplinary project was conducted to study the impact of an important phosphogypsum discharge (50 million tons discharged near gabes city over twenty years). analysis of remote sensing data (landsat mss, spot xs and p, noaa avhrr) combined with field measurements were used to describe actual and historical states and begin understanding alteration mechanisms. the satellite information concerns bottom changes, sea color, sea surface temperature, and swell.
drastic changes have occurred in the gabes gulf to the west of the gneiss-djerba sill. the seagrass beds and caulerpa fields that covered most part of the gulf are now restricted to some areas upwards of 10m depth. under hydrodynamic processes, bare sediments can be re-suspended more easily. light reaching the bottom is reduced, inducing a shift from bottom primary production to a planktonic one. other contributory factors are discussed.",00253324,Marine technology society journal,0.291

A blind poisson-gaussian noise separation using learning copula densities," model copula denoising , mixture gaussian and poisson , learning , admm","This paper develops a novel copula denoising optimization solution for separating poisson noise from images, or removing mixtures of poisson and gaussian noise. the proposed approach is elaborated in two steps: first, a spatial bilateral total variation (btv) regularization is used to reduce gaussian noise; second, a learning copula procedure is employed to separate the poisson noise from the ideal image. this leads to capture different image features while significantly reducing the noise. analytically, we include results on the approximation of the poisson component as well as the resolution of the proposed optimization model. in addition, to resolve the btv minimization problem, we proposed an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. finally, numerical results are provided to remove noise while preserving important details and features, along with convincing comparisons to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. we show, in particular, that using a large database can improve the robustness of the proposed algorithm.",0278081X,Circuits systems and signal processing,0.509

Fast bidimensional empirical mode decomposition based on an adaptive block partitioning," bemd , fast adaptive lapped block , edge variance information , block-based bemd method , blocking artefact , lapped block-based bemd method","The decomposition of images with great size using the bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (bemd) necessitates an important calculation time. to overcome this problem we first proposed in [1] a new approach using block-based bemd method (bbemd) where an input image is subdivided into four subblocks, and then the bemd is applied on each of the four blocks separately. this method offered a good solution to the calculation time, unfortunately blocking artefact is noticeable in the resulting modes, this is a result of ignoring the interblock correlation during the bemd process and every block was taken as an independent entity when interpolating the blocks borders in the sifting process. the lapped block-based bemd (lbbemd) is then proposed to whelm the artefact problem using for every block the neighbouring information by enlarging the block neighbourhood related to the two adjacent blocks inside the image during the blocks decomposition. enlarging neighbourhood blocks necessitate intensive simulations to have for each block the corresponding enlargement size, thing that affects remarkably on the calculation time. experimentation shows that the lbbemd can not handle correctly the artefact problems, because the enlargement size can not be enough ""or too big"" to surround all the concerned pixels for each block in the image. the problem with the lbbemd is to exactly define, a priori, for each block the size of the neighbouring enlargement size. in this paper, we will present an adaptive and fast block empirical mode decomposition to eliminate definitively the artefacts problems when subdividing an image into lapped blocks and we will prove, by simulations, that our method offers a good trade-off between computational time and decomposition quality.",17387906,International journal of computer science and network security,N/A

Exact trajectory solutions of a spherical microswimmer under flow and external fields," dilute suspension , particles , rheology , motion","The main objective of the present study is the derivation of exact analytical expressions for the orientation and trajectory of a spherical microswimmer submitted to general linear flows and to an external (gravitational or magnetic) force field, a problem known as gyrotaxis or magnetotaxis. we consider linear shear, hyperbolic, solid-rotation, and stagnation flows. the evolution equations of the swimmer orientation and its position are nonlinear and analytical results are the exception rather than the rule. most available results for cell orientation and trajectories are obtained numerically. the solution for the swimmer orientation is inspired from a method due to bretherton, initially developed for a different nonlinear equation. we show here that this method can be generalized to our evolution equation. we see that the swimmer under flow exhibits both run (a motion where the orientation angle is kept constant with time) and tumble (the orientation angle is cyclic with time) regimes, and a variety of cell trajectories are extracted analytically, such as parabolic, elliptic, and helical. this study offers a framework to generalize the results to other types of flows.",2469990X,Physical review fluids,1.066
Characterizing environmental geographic inequalities using an integrated exposure assessment," population exposure , ambient air , health , exposome , models inequities , spatial , exposure , modeling , integrated","Background at a regional or continental scale, the characterization of environmental health inequities (ehi) expresses the idea that populations are not equal in the face of pollution. it implies an analysis be conducted in order to identify and manage the areas at risk of overexposure where an increasing risk to human health is suspected. the development of methods is a prerequisite for implementing public health activities aimed at protecting populations. methods this paper presents the methodological framework developed by ineris (french national institute for industrial environment and risks) to identify a common framework for a structured and operationalized assessment of human exposure. an integrated exposure assessment approach has been developed to integrate the multiplicity of exposure pathways from various sources, through a series of models enabling the final exposure of a population to be defined. results measured data from environmental networks reflecting the actual contamination of the environment are used to gauge the population's exposure. sophisticated methods of spatial analysis are applied to include additional information and take benefit of spatial and inter-variable correlation to improve data representativeness and characterize the associated uncertainty. integrated approaches bring together all the information available for assessing the source-to-human-dose continuum using a geographic information system, multimedia exposure and toxicokinetic model. discussion one of the objectives of the integrated approach was to demonstrate the feasibility of building complex realistic exposure scenarios satisfying the needs of stakeholders and the accuracy of the modelling predictions at a fine spatial-temporal resolution. a case study is presented to provide a specific application of the proposed framework and how the results could be used to identify an overexposed population. conclusion this framework could be used for many purposes, such as mapping ehi, identifying vulnerable populations and providing determinants of exposure to manage and plan remedial actions and to assess the spatial relationships between health and the environment to identify factors that influence the variability of disease patterns.",1476069X,Environmental health,1.228
Spatio-temporal assessment of pregnant women exposure to chlorpyrifos at a regional scale," exposome , environment , pesticides","Background the aim of this study was to use an integrated exposure assessment approach, combining spatiotemporal modeling of environmental exposure and fate of the chemical to assess the exposure of vulnerable populations. in this study, chlorpyrifos exposure of pregnant women in picardy was evaluated at a regional scale during 1 year. this approach provided a mapping of exposure indicators of pregnant women to chlorpyrifos over fine spatial and temporal resolutions using a gis environment.
methods fate and transport models (emission, atmospheric dispersion, multimedia exposure, pbpk) were combined with environmental databases in a gis environment. quantities spread over agricultural fields were simulated and integrated into a modeling chain coupling models. the fate and transport of chlorpyrifos was characterized by an atmospheric dispersion statistical metamodel and the dynamicrop model. then, the multimedia model modul'ers was used to predict chlorpyrifos daily exposure doses which were integrated in a pbpk model to compute biomarker of exposure (tcpy urinary concentrations). for the concentration predictions, two scenarios (lower bound and upper bound) were built.
results at fine spatio-temporal resolutions, the cartography of biomarkers in the lower bound scenario clearly highlights agricultural areas. in these maps, some specific areas and hotspots appear as potentially more exposed specifically during application period. overall, predictions were close to biomonitoring data and ingestion route was the main contributor to chlorpyrifos exposure.
conclusions this study demonstrated the feasibility of an integrated approach for the evaluation of chlorpyrifos exposure which allows the comparison between modeled predictions and biomonitoring data.",15590631,Journal of exposure science and environmental epidemiology,1.026

Rheological properties of a vesicle suspension," shear , dynamics , deformation , motion","The rheological behavior of a dilute suspension of vesicles in linear shear flow at a finite concentration is analytically examined. in the quasispherical limit, two coupled nonlinear equations that describe the vesicle orientation in the flow and its shape evolution were derived [phys. rev. lett. 96, 028104 (2006)] and serve here as a starting point. of special interest is to provide, for the first time, an exact analytical prediction of the time-dependent effective viscosity eta(eff) and normal stress differences n-1 and n-2. our results shed light on the effect of the viscosity ratio lambda (defined as the inner over the outer fluid viscosities) as the main controlling parameter. it is shown that eta(eff), n-1, and n-2 either tend to a steady state or describe a periodic time-dependent rheological response, previously reported numerically and experimentally. in particular, the shear viscosity minimum and the cusp singularities of eta(eff), n-1, and n-2 at the tumbling threshold are brought to light. we also report on rheology properties for an arbitrary linear flow. we were able to obtain a constitutive law in a closed form relating the stress tensor to the strain rate tensor. it is found that the resulting constitutive markedly contrasts with classical laws known for other complex fluids, such as emulsions, capsule suspensions, and dilute polymer solutions (oldroyd b model). we highlight the main differences between our law and classical laws.",15393755,Physical review e,N/A

results: this paper is presenting a new model for analyzing the propagation of ionic concentrations and electrical potential in space and time. in this model, the transport of ions is governed by nernst-planck flux equation (np), and the electrical interaction of the species is described by a new cable equation. these set of equations form a system of coupled partial nonlinear differential equations that is solved numerically. in the first we describe the mathematical model. to realize the numerical simulation of our model, we proceed by a finite element discretization and then we choose an appropriate resolution algorithm.
conclusions: we give numerical simulations obtained for different input scenarios in the case of suicide substrate reaction which were compared to those obtained in literature. these input scenarios have been chosen so as to provide an intuitive understanding of dynamics of the model. by accessing time and space domains, it is shown that interpreting the electrical potential of cell membrane at steady state is incorrect. this model is general and applies to ions of any charge in space and time domains. the results obtained show a complete agreement with literature findings and also with the physical interpretation of the phenomenon. furthermore, various numerical experiments are presented to confirm the accuracy, efficiency and stability of the proposed method. in particular, we show that the scheme is second-order accurate in space.",17424682,Theoretical biology and medical modelling,0.303

Extraction of opinion target using syntactic rules in urdu text," product feature-extraction , sentiment analysis aspect-based sentiment analysis , opinion mining , opinion target extraction , sentiment analysis in urdu , aspect extraction","Opinion target or aspect extraction is the key task of aspect-based sentiment analysis. this task focuses on the extraction of targeted words or phrases against which a user has expressed his/her opinion. although, opinion target extraction has been studied extensively in the english language domain, with notable work in other languages such as chinese, arabic etc., other regional languages have been neglected. one of the reasons is the lack of resources and available texts for these languages. urdu is one, with millions of native and non-native speakers across the globe. in this paper, the urdu language domain is focused on to identify opinion targets from written urdu texts. to accomplish this task, several syntactic rules are crafted to identify users' opinions and associated target words. these rules are crafted using the grammatical and linguistic context of the words in the sentence. to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work available in the urdu domain for opinion target extraction. the proposed methodology is evaluated on an urdu language dataset and compared with an existing approach for the english language by applying the same technique. the experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves promising performance as compared to the applied english language domain approach.",10798587,Intelligent automation and soft computing,0.338

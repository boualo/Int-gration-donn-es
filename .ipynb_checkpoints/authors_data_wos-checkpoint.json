                "Résumé": "Solar radiation (Rs) is vital and profoundly influences the environment. Accurate forecasting of Rs is crucial in renewable energy applications, despite its nonlinearity and dependency on loads. To overcome limitations in measurement tools, various methodologies are employed to estimate Rs using alternative environmental parameters. In our article, we present an innovative framework that explores the impact of feature selection (FS) on time series for accurate global Rs forecasting. This framework provides a holistic approach to recursive feature elimination (RFE) and its integration with various models such as random forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Person (Per) and Gradient Boosting Models (GBM). The obtained results reveal that the CART, LR, and GBM models exhibit strong predictive accuracies of 0.894, 0.884, and 0.882, respectively. Notably, these three methods demonstrate a consistent standard deviation (std) of 0.033, indicating stability in their performance. Evaluating the normalized mean absolute error (nMAE) standard deviation (std), the models achieve values of 0.892 (0.029), 0.885 (0.034), and 0.885 (0.035) respectively. Additionally, the RFE algorithm showcases the significant impact of input lags as features and delivers good performance. Beyond accuracy, our findings hold practical implications for renewable energy planning, daily operation of solar power plants, and investment decision-making, contributing to the optimization and sustainability of solar energy systems.",

However, Moroccans' acceptance and support for renewable energy are important to accelerate renewable deployment and increase the share of renewables in the total power capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study in the Middle East and North Africa region that addresses people's opinions on renewable energy using a natural language processing technique called sentiment analysis. The process started by collecting Moroccan's comments on renewable energy during the past 10 years. After preprocessing, we identified the polarity (positive or negative) of each comment by applying one of the sentiment analysis approaches, namely a rule-based approach. As a result, Moroccans do not show a high positive sentiment toward renewables, which means there is a need for more public awareness. Further, Moroccans show more attention to wind and solar energy than other types of renewables because of the naturally available resources. In terms of energy policy, the public indicates that the Moroccan government focuses on big projects and does not encourage energy self-sufficiency. As a powerhouse in this domain, Morocco may consider educating and encouraging people to use renewables in order to win more support for clean energy, reduce its energy dependency, and help the growth of the renewables business.",

                "Résumé": "Solar irradiation (Rs) is the electromagnetic radiation energy emitted by the Sun. It plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth by providing light, heat, and energy. Furthermore, it serves as a key driver of Earth's climate and weather systems, influencing the distribution of heat across the planet, shaping global air and ocean currents, and determining weather patterns. Variations in Rs levels have significant implications for climate change and long-term climate trends. Moreover, Rs represents an abundant and renewable energy resource, offering a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. By harnessing solar energy, we can actively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the utilization of Rs comes with its own challenges that must be addressed. One problem is its variability, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for consistent solar energy generation. Its intermittent nature also poses difficulties in meeting continuous energy demand unless appropriate energy storage or backup systems are in place. Integrating large-scale solar energy systems into existing power grids can present technical challenges. Rs levels are influenced by various factors; understanding these factors is crucial for various applications, such as renewable energy planning, climate modeling, and environmental studies. Overcoming the associated challenges requires advancements in technology and innovative solutions. Measuring and harnessing Rs for various applications can be achieved using various devices; however, the expense and scarcity of measuring equipment pose challenges in accurately assessing and monitoring Rs levels. In order to address this, alternative methods have been developed with which to estimate Rs, including artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) models, like neural networks, kernel algorithms, tree-based models, and ensemble methods. To demonstrate the impact of feature selection methods on Rs predictions, we propose a Multivariate Time Series (MVTS) model using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a decision tree (DT), Pearson correlation (Pr), logistic regression (LR), Gradient Boosting Models (GBM), and a random forest (RF). Our article introduces a novel framework that integrates various models and incorporates overlooked factors. This framework offers a more comprehensive understanding of Recursive Feature Elimination and its integrations with different models in multivariate solar radiation forecasting. Our research delves into unexplored aspects and challenges existing theories related to solar radiation forecasting. Our results show reliable predictions based on essential criteria. The feature ranking may vary depending on the model used, with the RF Regressor algorithm selecting features such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and relative humidity for specific months. The DT algorithm may yield a slightly different set of selected features. Despite the variations, all of the models exhibit impressive performance, with the LR model demonstrating outstanding performance with low RMSE (0.003) and the highest R2 score (0.002). The other models also show promising results, with RMSE scores ranging from 0.006 to 0.007 and a consistent R2 score of 0.999.",

To improve the chatbot's performance, personalization techniques are employed to deliver customized information to each user based on their interests. Additionally, sentiment analysis techniques are utilized to better understand the user's queries and emotional state. The goal is to better understand the user and his needs to deliver the required information. In this work, we propose a personalized chatbot enhanced with sentiment analysis features to provide useful and tailored information for each user. The paper details the system's key components and the techniques employed for handling user queries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we have implemented a proof-of-concept version as customer service chatbot in e-commerce applications. The experimental results obtained based on users' feedback indicate a significant improvement in user satisfaction with the customized answers and the overall experience. Overall, this system demonstrates the potential of utilizing sentiment analysis in conjunction with personalization techniques to improve the performance and effectiveness of chatbots and question-answering systems.",

Such systems depend mainly on collecting user data to create profiles that represent user interests. While collecting user data is essential for improving the quality of the returned results, it has also raised serious concerns regarding user privacy. Giving the user a personalized browsing experience usually comes at the cost of his privacy. Thus, most people are afraid of using such applications. Current search engines lack dedicated privacy-preserving features and do not fulfill people's expectations in terms of privacy. Researchers have been investigating solutions to overcome this issue and create privacy-aware personalized systems. In this paper, we present an overview of the current privacy threats in personalized search systems with a threat modeling approach.

So far, more than 108 million confirmed cases have been recorded, and 2.3 million deaths (according to Statistica data platform). This has created a calamitous situation around the world and fears that the disease will affect everyone in future. Deep learning algorithms could be an effective solution to track COVID-19, predict its growth, and design strategies and policies to manage its spread. Our work applies a mathematical model to analyze and predict the propagation of coronavirus in Morocco by using deep learning techniques applied on time series data. In all tested models, long short-term memory (LSTM) model showed a better performance on predicting daily confirmed cases. The forecasting is based on history of daily confirmed cases recorded from March 2, 2020, the day the first case appeared in Morocco, until February 10, 2020.",

                "Résumé": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost every country causing devastating economic and social disruption and stretching healthcare systems to the limit. Furthermore, while being the current gold standard, existing test methods including NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests), clinical analysis of chest CT (Computer Tomography) scan images, and blood test results, require in-person visits to a hospital which is not an adequate way to control such a highly contagious pandemic. Therefore, top priority must be given, among other things, to enlisting recent and adequate technologies to reduce the adverse impact of this pandemic. Modern smartphones possess a rich variety of embedded MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems) sensors capable of recording movements, temperature, audio, and video of their carriers. This study leverages the smartphone sensors for the preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19. Deep learning, an important breakthrough in the domain of artificial intelligence in the past decade, has huge potential for extracting apt and appropriate features in healthcare. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents a new framework that leverages advanced machine learning and data analytics techniques for the early detection of coronavirus disease using smartphone embedded sensors. The proposal provides a simple to use and quickly deployable screening tool that can be easily configured with a smartphone. Experimental results indicate that the model can detect positive cases with an overall accuracy of 79% using only the data from the smartphone sensors. This means that the patient can either be isolated or treated immediately to prevent further spread, thereby saving more lives. The proposed approach does not involve any medical tests and is a cost-effective solution that provides robust results.",

The fast evolution of Internet-based applications like websites, social networks, and blogs, leads people to generate enormous heaps of opinions and reviews about products, services, and day-to-day activities. Sentiment analysis poses as a powerful tool for businesses, governments, and researchers to extract and analyze public mood and views, gain business insight, and make better decisions. This paper presents a complete study of sentiment analysis approaches, challenges, and trends, to give researchers a global survey on sentiment analysis and its related fields. The paper presents the applications of sentiment analysis and describes the generic process of this task. Then, it reviews, compares, and investigates the used approaches to have an exhaustive view of their advantages and drawbacks. The challenges of sentiment analysis are discussed next to clarify future directions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

                "Résumé": "The problem of information overload on the Internet increased the need for personalized information retrieval (PIR) systems capable of providing information that corresponds to the user interests. Although, for most people, the word personalization comes with trust issues and privacy concerns. Since giving the user a personalized browsing experience usually comes at the cost of his privacy. Thus, most people are afraid of using such applications. To address this issue, we propose a new model for privacy protection in PIR systems. Our model aims at achieving a trade-off between the personalization quality and the privacy risk, to keep the latter under control. We have studied the assets and drawbacks of the existing profile-based PIR structures, from a privacy protection perspective, along with the possible privacy threats in this field in a threat modeling approach. The model we propose is based on the vector space model and targets profile-based PIR systems. It uses query expansion and re-ranking algorithms on the client-side to ensure personalization quality. While privacy protection is ensured during the personalization process, by taking into consideration the user's privacy requirements, and through encryption. We use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to protect user data at-rest and a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme for data in-transit and in-use protection. To prove the feasibility and efficiency of our model, this paper includes a proof-of-concept implementation with proper experimental results.",

These models have been widely utilized to extract semantic and syntactic features for sentiment analysis. However, using word embedding models cannot be sufficient for sentiment analysis tasks because they do not contain sentiment features. Therefore, word embedding models do not adequately meet the comprehensive needs of sentiment analysis applications that rely on recognizing the polarity of a sentence. In this paper, we propose a sentiment embedding model (Word2Sent model) to tackle the weaknesses of the existing word embedding models for sentiment analysis applications. We developed this model based on the Continuous Bag-of-Words model and SentiWordNet lexicon to learn sentiment embedding for each word from its surrounding context words. It preserves semantic and syntactic features and captures implicitly sentiment ones. Besides, it can predict sentiment features in a very low sentiment embeddings dimension than traditional ones. The proposed method provides an improved sentiment classification performance and lowers the computational complexity. Both the accuracy performance and processing time results obtained indicate that the proposed model is particularly promising.",

This HE property can be considered as a useful solution to get over some concerns limiting the widespread adoption of CC services. Nevertheless, since CC environments are threatened by outsider and insider security attacks and since cloud consumers oftentimes access to CC services using resource-limited devices, the HE schemes need to be promoted in terms of security level and running time to work effectively. In El Makkaoui et al. ( 2016 international conference on big data and advanced wireless technologies, BDAW 2016, 2016b), we boosted the main Paillier's scheme at security level by proposing a variant of the scheme called Cloud-Paillier. The proposed scheme addresses an exception of the Paillier's scheme, supports the additive homomorphism over the integers and withstands more confidentiality attacks. For fast decryption, herein, we propose two fast variants of the Cloud-Paillier scheme. The proposed variants use moduli formed of k = 2 distinct primes. The first variant utilizes the Chinese remainder theorem to decrypt. Whereas, the second variant sightly modifies the from of the Cloud-Paillier's encryption algorithm and decrypts as in the Cloud-Paillier. Theoretical and simulation outcomes show that the suggested variants give a large decryption speed-up over the Cloud-Paillier while preserving a recommended security level.",

In this paradigm, MA migrates among sensor nodes (SNs) for data fusion. However, in comparison to traditional client/server paradigm; where each SN in the network sends its collected data to the sink, MA presents a good alternative in terms of energy consumption, response time and network lifetime. In this paradigm, the most critical properties of MA is the itinerary planning, it has always been an issue and a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we present a survey of the proposed itinerary planning approaches for MAs in WSNs. MA itinerary planning techniques can be classified into three categories: static itinerary planning, dynamic itinerary planning and hybrid itinerary planing. The benefits and shortcomings of different MA itinerary planning approaches are presented. Furthermore, we implement, simulate and compare the most prominent itinerary planning algorithms upon a common parameter space, making realistic network-level assumptions.",

                "Résumé": "The nature of VANET networks makes the network vulnerable to several attacks such as the black hole attack which is part of Denial of Service attacks (DOS). The aim of these attacks is to prohibit users from using one or more services by making the communication unavailable. In this sense and during the routing process, the malicious node tries to acquire the route by forging routing information in order to receive the data and then drops it without transferring it to its destination. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method of such attack during communication in a VANET network. This method is based on a variable control chart which is widely used in the industrial field to monitor the quality of a given process. This method can identify malicious nodes in real time by deploying the monitoring system in each receiving node within the network. Our method is easy to implement and does not require any modification to the 802.11p standard or the routing protocol as we will demonstrate by NS-2 simulations and SUMO microscopic and continuous road traffic simulator using a real map.",

In El Makkaoui et al. (Cloud-RSA: an enhanced homomorphic encryption scheme. In: Rocha A, Serrhini M, Felgueiras C (eds) Europe and MENA cooperation advances in information and communication technologies. Advances in intelligent systems and computing, vol 520. Springer, Cham, pp 471-480, 2017b), we boosted RSA scheme at security level, Cloud-RSA. In this paper, we suggest two variants of Cloud-RSA scheme in order to speed up its decryption process. The variants are based on modifying the form of Cloud-RSA modulus and exponents. The first variant uses a modulus formed of two or more distinct primes and employs the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) to encrypt and decrypt. Whereas, the second variant uses a modulus of the form n = p(r)q(s) for r >= 2 and s >= 1, and applies the Hensel lifting and the CRT to decrypt. Theoretical and simulation results show that the proposed variants provide a large decryption speedup over Cloud-RSA.",

This makes life in cities uncomfortable and costs a huge budget every year. Several resources are wasted during a bottling of fuel, weather, etc. In the ad hoc network of vehicles (VANET), useful information is exchanged between vehicles and traffic to avoid congestion and ensure easy fluidity. Vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V) is a means of transmitting this information in a VANET network. The immense amount of data that can be generated by a VANET network makes processing difficult for traditional tools to take advantage of its generated data. In this paper, we propose an approach based on big data tools to analyse the floating data in a VANET network and to detect the congested roads each based on occupancy rate of the roads, we detect the congested roads in the monitored area. Then, exctract more details about the congestion occurred by identifying the congestion interval and the peak instants in this interval. Simulations are done using the SUMO mobilisation generator and the NS-2 simulator.",

In terms of energy consumption and overall time response, MA computing paradigm presents a better alternative. Instead of sending the collected data to the sink as in client/server, MA moves to sensor nodes (SNs) for data collection. For MA, to move among SNs, an itinerary should be planned before the migration. Many approaches have been proposed to solve the problem, but all approaches did not take into consideration the fault tolerance problem, even though WSNs are prone to failure. In this respect, we propose Energy efficient and fault tolerant distributed algorithm for data aggregation in wireless sensor networks (EFTA) to plan the itinerary for MA and another alternative itinerary in case of node(s) failure. Our algorithm adopts a clustering method to group SNs in clusters then plans the itinerary among those clusters efficiently. Also an alternative itinerary based fault tolerance is proposed. Simulation results show that our algorithm performs better than other existing ones.",

During a traffic jam, several resources are wasted, such as time, fuel and many other resources. Through the VANET networks, we can circulate useful information on the state of the traffic in order to guarantee fluidity and an easy circulation. The vehicleto -vehicle (V2V) communication is a way of transmitting this information in a VANET network.

For the first time, a natural on-line training with only one sample, to extract both eigen-weights and eigen-bias, for each odor is built herein to elaborate a natural identifier neural model in a real work environment. The proposed model efficiently reduces the maximum extent of traditional neural models complexities, namely generic work-laboratory, dimensional data learning (typically from 60 to 80), model adaptability complication, time-consuming, heavy experiment materials and chemical products. The outcomes show that the invented model identifies correctly 100 the three hazardous contaminants of the test data (all data minus only three samples for learning) processed from gas sensors weakened in the harshest conditions. Therewith, this natural identifier model methodology is elaborated easily enough to be efficient in different environments conditions to accurately control the air quality safety in any local area.",

This model knows difficult problems related to low-level and batch nature of MR that gives rise to an abstraction layer on the top of MR. Therefore; several High-Level MapReduce Query Languages built on the top of MR provide more abstract query languages and extend the MR programming model. These High-Level MapReduce Query Languages remove the burden of MR programming away from the developers and make a soft migration of existing competences with SQL skills to Big Data. This paper investigates the very used-common High-Level MapReduce Query Languages built directly on the top of MR that translate queries into executable native MR jobs. It evaluates the performance of the four presented High-Level MapReduce Query Languages: JAQL, Hive, Big SQL and Pig, with regards to their insightful perspectives and ease of programming. The baseline metrics reported are increasing input size, scale-out number of nodes and controlling number of reducers. The experimental results study the technical advantages and limitations of each High-Level MapReduce Query Languages. Finally, the paper provides a summary for developers to choose the High-Level MapReduce Query Languages which fulfill their needs and interests.",

However, most existing e-learning platforms offer traditional e-learning system in order that learners access the same evaluation and learning content. In response, Big Data technology in the proposed adaptive e-learning model allowed to consider new approaches and new learning strategies. In this paper, we propose an adaptive e-learning model for providing the most suitable learning content for each learner. This model based on two levels of adaptive e-learning. The first level involves two steps: (1) determining the relevant future educational objectives through the adequate learner e-assessment method using MapReduce-based Genetic Algorithm, (2) generating adaptive learning path for each learner using the MapReduce-based Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. In the second level, we propose MapReduce-based Social Networks Analysis for determining the learner motivation and social productivity in order to assign a specific learning rhythm to each learner. Finally, the experimental results show that the presented algorithms implemented on Big Data environment converge much better than those implementations with traditional concurrent works. Also, this work provides main benefit because it describes how Big Data technology transforms e-learning paradigm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

                "Résumé": "Mobile agent (MA)-based wireless sensor networks present a good alternative to the traditional client/server paradigm. Instead of sending the data gathered by each node to the sink as in client/server, MAs migrate to the sensor nodes (SNs) to collect data, thus reducing energy consumption and bandwidth usage. For MAs, to migrate among SNs, an itinerary should be planned before the migration. Many approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of itinerary planning for MAs, but all of these approaches are based on the assumption that MAs visit all SNs. This assumption, however, is inefficient because of the increasing size of the MAs after visiting each node. Also, in case of node(s) failure, as it is often the case in WSNs, the MAs may not be able to migrate among SNs. None of the proposed approaches takes into consideration the problem of fault tolerance. In this paper, we propose multi-mobile agent itinerary planning-based energy and fault aware data aggregation in wireless sensor networks (MAEF) to plan itineraries for MAs. This can be achieved by grouping nodes in clusters and planning itineraries efficiently among cluster heads (CHs) only. What is more, an alternative itinerary is planned in case of node(s) failure. The simulation result clearly shows that our novel approach performs better than the existing ones.",

Big data is characterized by data that have a large volume, massive velocity, numerous variety, useful value, and veracity. Big Data Analytics offers tremendous insights to different organizations especially in healthcare. Currently, Big healthcare data has the highest potential for improving patient outcomes, gaining valuable insights, predicting outbreaks of epidemics, avoiding preventable diseases and effectively minimizing the cost of healthcare delivery.\nHowever, the dynamic nature of health data presents various conceptual, technical, legal and ethical challenges associated with the data processing and analysis activities. The big data security and privacy concepts are some of the most pertinent issues and have become increasingly significant associated with big healthcare data in the modern world.\nIn this paper, we give an overview of big data characteristics and challenges in healthcare and present big healthcare data lifecycle integrated with security threats and attacks to provide encompass policies and mechanisms that aim at solving the various security challenges in each step of big data lifecycle. The focus is also placed on the description of the recently proposed techniques related to authentication, encryption, anonymization, access control, and privacy. We finally propose an approach to secure threat model for big healthcare data lifecycle as a main contribution of this paper. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

                "Résumé": "Concerns over the confidentiality of sensitive data are still the main obstacles limiting the wide-spread adoption of cloud services. Actually, scientists have suggested a new encryption form, called homomorphic encryption (HE), which can offer a third-party having the ability to perform operations on encrypted data. The HE property can be considered as a useful method to get over these concerns. Since cloud environments are threatened by outsider/insider security attacks and since the cloud consumers oftentimes access to cloud services utilizing resource-limited devices, the HE schemes need to be promoted in terms of security level and running time to work effectively. At BDAW' 16, we boosted a Paillier scheme at the security level, we refer to as Cloud-Paillier. In this paper, we propose a fast variant of Cloud-Paillier scheme to accelerate its decryption process. The variant employs the Chinese remaindering to decrypt. Simulation results show that the proposed variant provides a large decryption speedup over Cloud-Paillier scheme while preserves the same security level. (C) 2018 The Authors.

As soon as the SOM is developed, with the whole key parameters, carefully selected (as Epanichnikov kernel function), to automatic elimination of uninformative signals, the few useful signals are MLP trained to optimally determine the model to improve the results performance. Fast precise identification, short execution duration, small local data, having strong signals selected, are all required to attenuate the sensors several criticalities emerged from the lowest content (1 ppm) of interfering mixed gases at relative humidity presence. Moreover, the practical application of this hybrid tool on 1ppm concentration has another advantage to ensure the air quality, either in critical condition control or in safety. (C) 2018 The Authors.

                "Résumé": "Recently, mobile agents use in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for data aggregation has acquired considerable attention. In client-server, sensor nodes (SNs) collect data and transmitted back to the base station or sink and thus consuming sensor nodes energy and surcharge the network bandwidth. Software entities called mobile agents (MAs) migrate among SNs in parallel for data collection, and then send this data back to the sink. It has been proven that itinerary planning for MAs in this paradigm is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, many solutions have been proposed to solve this problem. This paper, presents a novel itinerary planning algorithm for MAs based on cluster heads (CHs). In our proposed approach, instead of planning itinerary among all SNs, we plan itinerary just among CHs. First, we group SNs in clusters based on density of SNs then select some SNs as CHs. Second, we plan itineraries for MAs just among CHs based on minimum spanning tree algorithm (MST). At the end, we dispatch an optimal number of MAs for data collection and gathering from CHs. Simulation result shows that our MA Protocol based Energy aware data aggregation (MAPE) for WSNs performs better than previous proposed approaches. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

In fact, researchers have invented a new promising form of encryption, homomorphic encryption, that can be considered as an effective way to overcome these obstacles. Since cloud computing environment is more threatened by attacks and since cloud consumers often use resource-constrained devices to access to cloud computing services, the homomorphic encryption schemes must be promoted, in terms of security level and running time, to work efficiently. At EMENA-TSSL'16, we boosted the standard RSA encryption scheme at security level, Cloud-RSA. In this paper, we propose a new fast variant of the Cloud-RSA scheme to speed up its algorithms. The proposed variant uses a modulus of the form N = p(r)q(s) for r, s >= 2 and employs Hensel lifting and Chinese remaindering to decrypt. Simulation results show that the proposed variant gives a large speed up over the Cloud-RSA scheme while preserving a prescribed security level. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

Taking advantage of the amount of information is now available, research and industry have sought ways to automatically analyze sentiments and user opinions expressed in social networks. In this paper, we place ourselves in a difficult context, on the sentiments that could thinking of suicide. In particular, we propose to address the lack of terminological resources related to suicide by a method of constructing a vocabulary associated with suicide. We then propose, for a better analysis, to investigate Weka as a tool of data mining based on machine learning algorithms that can extract useful information from Twitter data collected by Twitter4J. Therefore, an algorithm of computing semantic analysis between tweets in training set and tweets in data set based on WordNet is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on machine learning algorithms and semantic sentiment analysis can extract predictions of suicidal ideation using Twitter Data. In addition, this work verify the effectiveness of performance in term of accuracy and precision on semantic sentiment analysis that could thinking of suicide. (C) 2017 The Authors.

While this data is being hailed as the key to improving health outcomes, gain valuable insights and lowering costs, the security and privacy issues are so overwhelming that healthcare industry is unable to take full advantage of it with its current resources. Managing and harnessing the analytical power of big data, however, is vital to the success of all healthcare organizations. It is in this context that this paper aims to present the state-of-the-art security and privacy issues in big data as applied to healthcare industry and discuss some available data privacy, data security, users accessing mechanisms and strategies.

The purposes of creating this type of communication network are handling traffic and ensure a safe driving by delivering some useful information to users. To guarantee this, we have to secure the communication by predicting serval security issues to handle them before setting up this network in the real life. One of these issues is the Black Hole Attack. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect the black hole attack using a quality control chart. This method acts in real-time by monitoring the network activity using graphic representations to detect any abnormal behavior during the communication process. (c) 2017 The Authors.

                "Résumé": "In IEEE 802.11 standard, the wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) provides transmission fairness to nodes in a network, but some nodes that called misbehaving nodes (MNs) can take advantage and modify its MAC parameters to improve its own performance at the expense of other nodes (honest nodes HNs). Many solutions have been proposed to solve this problem, but most of these solutions are based on the assumption that MNs misbehave just one time. Therefor, in this paper, we propose a boycott based enhanced correction scheme for mac layer misbehavior in wireless networks to correct and react against MNs and increasing the HNs throughput. To correct these MNs, HNs collectively react and correct the MNs. When the misbehavior is detected for the first time, HNs react in an appropriate way by decreasing the throughput of MNs, but if MNs misbehave for the second time HNs start to react aggressively and consequently decrease MNs throughput dramatically. In the third misbehavior, HNs boycott the MNs and reject all messages that came from these nodes. Simulation result shows the efficiency of our proposed scheme to improve HNs throughput and boycott MNs. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

Moreover, the first demarche of the sentiment analysis is the pre-processing of data collected from Social Media. Most of existing research works that deals with social media analysis based on extracting new features related to sentiment. This paper presents the usage of Twitter in a number of proposed subjects, which is the largest social networking website where Twitter data is in increasing at higher rates every day that considers it as Big Data Source. Then, describing in detail the way in which Big data technology, such as, InfoSphere BigInsights enables processing of this data, which are primarily collected from social networks by Apache Flume and stored in Hadoop storage. In addition, we have investigated a Big Data platform for collecting social media data based on Apache Flume and analyzing this data using InfoSphere BigInsights. Moreover, our paper integrates the visualization of these analysis results using BigSheets. To that end, evaluation through analysis of results confirms that the proposed Big Data platform produces better results in terms of social media analysis. (C) 2017 The Authors.

With the growing size of the network this model become inefficient, because of the huge amount of the data that should be processed to the sink, therefore mobile agent model present a good alternative to the traditional client-server model. In this model a mobile code migrate to the source nodes to collect data. It has been proven that planning itinerary for the mobile agent is a NP-Hard problem. In this paper, we present a hybrid scheme of client-server and mobile agent. At first we organize nodes in clusters, then select a node at the center as cluster head that will be responsible of clusters' data collection, after that we plan the itinerary among those cluster heads using minimum spanning tree, then dispatch the mobile agent to collect data from cluster heads. Simulations results show that our novel proposed scheme perform better in comparison to the existing schemes.",

It's known that IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN medium access control (MAC) provides transmission fairness to nodes in a network. But some nodes can take advantage and modify its MAC to improve its own performance at the expense of other nodes. To handle these misbehaving nodes, we use a backslide strategy to react against the misbehaving nodes, which is based on the number of times the misbehaving nodes they misbehave. Extensive simulation results are presented to validate our proposed strategy by improving honest nodes throughput and then the performance of the network.",

Then we study the state of the art of different approaches for computing the similarity of amount documents to choose the approach that will be used in our MapReduce algorithm.

The decrypted result of any operation is the same such as working directly on raw data. The ability to perform computations on ciphertexts makes homomorphic encryption a widely adopted technique for ensuring confidentiality of both storage and treatment of outsourced data into a third party. Indeed, the RSA is the first asymmetric-key encryption scheme with a homomorphic property. Unfortunately, many attacks can threaten the encrypted data confidentiality of this scheme. In this paper, we will address the standard RSA drawbacks by suggesting an enhanced encryption scheme of it, which keeps a homomorphic property and resists more the well-known attacks against RSA.",

Measuring the similarity of documents are crucial components of many text-analysis tasks, including information retrieval, document classification, and document clustering. However, there are a growing number of tasks that require computing the similarity between two very short segments of text. There exist a large number of composed documents in a large amount of corpus. Most of them are required to compute the similarity for validation. In this paper, we propose our approach of measuring similarity between documents in large amount of corpus. For evaluation, we compare the proposed approach with other approaches previously presented by using our new MapReduce algorithm. Simulation results, on Hadoop framework, show that our new MapReduce algorithm outperforms the classical ones in term of running time performance and increases the value of the similarity.",

                "Résumé": "This report describes the work done for training and testing Arabic speech recognition system using the KALDI toolkit. Each person's voice is different. Thus, the Holy Quran sound, which had been recited by most of reciters will probably tend to differ a lot from one person to another. Although those Quranic sentences were particularly taken from the same verse, but the way of the sentence in The Holy Quran been recited or delivered may be different. It may produce the contrast sounds for the different reciters. Those same combinations of letters maybe pronounced differently due to the use of diacritics. This paper explores the viability of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) technique to extract features from Quranic verse recitation. Features extraction is important to prepare data for classification process. MFCC is one of the most popular feature extraction techniques used in speech recognition, whereby it is based on the frequency domain of Mel scale for human ear scale. MFCCs consist of preprocessing, framing, windowing, DFT, Mel Filterbank, Logarithm and Discrete Cosine Transform DCT.",

                "Résumé": "The ability to perform computations on ciphertexts without knowing any information about the plaintexts makes homomorphic encryption technique useful in a wide variety of confidentiality preserving protocols (e.g., e-voting, e-health, etc.). Unfortunately, the traditional encyption schemes support a limited number of homomorphic operations (usually addition or multiplication). Indeed, in 2009, Gentry proposed a fully homomorphic encryption scheme which supports both multiplicative and additive homomorphic operations. Since then, several fully homomorphic encryption schemes have been proposed. However, the fully homomorphic encryption schemes are still undergoing experimentation and improvement. The hybridization of homomorphic encryption schemes seems to be an effective way to overcome their limitations and to benefit from their resistance against the confidentiality attacks. In this paper, we will study the possibility to hybridize the homomorphic encryption schemes so as to support all homomorphic properties.",

However, with the emergence of this technology, the concept of security and privacy has become a major barrier to cloud services adoption. Indeed, many research works have been done to identify cloud security and privacy issues. It is in this context that in this paper, we will provide a new cloud security and privacy model (CSPM) into layers which can be taken into account by cloud providers during all the stages of cloud services building and monitoring. This model will permit to overcome this cloud services barrier adoption and thus, to build confidence in cloud services and also to provide secure services. Finally, we will present some security threats and attacks, and propose, according to CSPM, some countermeasures.",

In this paper, we investigated MapReduce as a specific framework for managing distributed processing in dataset pattern and semantic similarity measures of documents. Then we study the state of the art of different approaches for computing the semantic similarity of documents. We propose an approach based on parallel algorithm of semantic similarity measures using MapReduce and WordNet to detect the relevant documents in the face of the query. Finally, we are leading basic experiments to assess the performance of the proposed approach and noted the leverage of Hadoop and MapReduce to the semantic similarity measures between documents.",

Cloud computing has become a widely adopted technology for delivering services over the Internet. However, the fear of seeing sensitive data be processed in clear has become a major barrier to cloud services adoption. Indeed, researchers have stressed a useful technique called \"homomorphic encryption\", this technique allows specific type of computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. The encryption schemes that support homomorphic properties are numerous; unfortunately, many attacks make these schemes insecure, especially when adopting these schemes to protect the confidentiality of outsourced data into the cloud due to the long time of storing the ciphertexts by the same key. To mitigate these drawbacks, in this paper we will suggest an enhanced version of the standard ElGamal encryption scheme which supports the multiplicative homomorphism and resists more the confidentiality attacks.",

In order to provide orthodontists a solution for classification of patients' images to evaluate the evolution of their treatment, we need to use latest efficient technics of classification. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on a decisional tree to classify and recognize 19 types of dental images. This hierarchical representation can be interpreted as a set of hierarchical types stored in leafs tree structure. By using several extracted features from color images acquired with a digital camera and grayscale images acquired by x-ray scanner. Such as facial features and skin color using YCbCr color-space. The proposed technique has been evaluated on a large data set of four main types namely: mold, intra-oral, extra-oral and radiographic images of different patients. Hence, experimental results demonstrate the good performances of this approach.",

                "Résumé": "With the emergence of cloud computing, the concept of information security has become a major issue. Indeed, the security of such a system is the greatest concern of computer scientists, providers of cloud and organizations who want to adopt and benefit from these services. Cloud computing providers must implement concepts ensuring network security, hardware, data storage and strategies of control and access to services. All these elements help to preserve data security and ensuring the availability of services associated with the Cloud, to better satisfy clients and acquire and build their trust. However, even if the data storage security in cloud servers is assured, reluctance remain when it comes to process the confidential data. Indeed, the fear that sensitive data is being used is a major obstacle in the adoption of cloud services by enterprises. To overcome this obstacle, the use of methods that can perform operations on encrypted data without knowing the secret key, seems to be an effective way to strengthen the confidentiality of information. In this paper we will examine the challenges facing Homomorphic Encryption methods to allow suppliers of cloud to perform operations on encrypted data, and provide the same results after treatment, as if they were performing calculations on raw data.",

However, Moroccans' acceptance and support for renewable energy are important to accelerate renewable deployment and increase the share of renewables in the total power capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study in the Middle East and North Africa region that addresses people's opinions on renewable energy using a natural language processing technique called sentiment analysis. The process started by collecting Moroccan's comments on renewable energy during the past 10 years. After preprocessing, we identified the polarity (positive or negative) of each comment by applying one of the sentiment analysis approaches, namely a rule-based approach. As a result, Moroccans do not show a high positive sentiment toward renewables, which means there is a need for more public awareness. Further, Moroccans show more attention to wind and solar energy than other types of renewables because of the naturally available resources. In terms of energy policy, the public indicates that the Moroccan government focuses on big projects and does not encourage energy self-sufficiency. As a powerhouse in this domain, Morocco may consider educating and encouraging people to use renewables in order to win more support for clean energy, reduce its energy dependency, and help the growth of the renewables business.",

Although, for most people, the word personalization comes with trust issues and privacy concerns. Since giving the user a personalized browsing experience usually comes at the cost of his privacy. Thus, most people are afraid of using such applications. To address this issue, we propose a new model for privacy protection in PIR systems. Our model aims at achieving a trade-off between the personalization quality and the privacy risk, to keep the latter under control. We have studied the assets and drawbacks of the existing profile-based PIR structures, from a privacy protection perspective, along with the possible privacy threats in this field in a threat modeling approach. The model we propose is based on the vector space model and targets profile-based PIR systems. It uses query expansion and re-ranking algorithms on the client-side to ensure personalization quality. While privacy protection is ensured during the personalization process, by taking into consideration the user's privacy requirements, and through encryption. We use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to protect user data at-rest and a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme for data in-transit and in-use protection. To prove the feasibility and efficiency of our model, this paper includes a proof-of-concept implementation with proper experimental results.",

                "Résumé": "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), mobile agent (MA) is a new paradigm that has gained more attention lately. In this paradigm, MA migrates among sensor nodes (SNs) for data fusion. However, in comparison to traditional client/server paradigm; where each SN in the network sends its collected data to the sink, MA presents a good alternative in terms of energy consumption, response time and network lifetime. In this paradigm, the most critical properties of MA is the itinerary planning, it has always been an issue and a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we present a survey of the proposed itinerary planning approaches for MAs in WSNs. MA itinerary planning techniques can be classified into three categories: static itinerary planning, dynamic itinerary planning and hybrid itinerary planing. The benefits and shortcomings of different MA itinerary planning approaches are presented. Furthermore, we implement, simulate and compare the most prominent itinerary planning algorithms upon a common parameter space, making realistic network-level assumptions.",

This makes life in cities uncomfortable and costs a huge budget every year. Several resources are wasted during a bottling of fuel, weather, etc. In the ad hoc network of vehicles (VANET), useful information is exchanged between vehicles and traffic to avoid congestion and ensure easy fluidity. Vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V) is a means of transmitting this information in a VANET network. The immense amount of data that can be generated by a VANET network makes processing difficult for traditional tools to take advantage of its generated data. In this paper, we propose an approach based on big data tools to analyse the floating data in a VANET network and to detect the congested roads each based on occupancy rate of the roads, we detect the congested roads in the monitored area. Then, exctract more details about the congestion occurred by identifying the congestion interval and the peak instants in this interval. Simulations are done using the SUMO mobilisation generator and the NS-2 simulator.",

Instead of sending the data gathered by each node to the sink as in client/server, MAs migrate to the sensor nodes (SNs) to collect data, thus reducing energy consumption and bandwidth usage. For MAs, to migrate among SNs, an itinerary should be planned before the migration. Many approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of itinerary planning for MAs, but all of these approaches are based on the assumption that MAs visit all SNs. This assumption, however, is inefficient because of the increasing size of the MAs after visiting each node. Also, in case of node(s) failure, as it is often the case in WSNs, the MAs may not be able to migrate among SNs. None of the proposed approaches takes into consideration the problem of fault tolerance. In this paper, we propose multi-mobile agent itinerary planning-based energy and fault aware data aggregation in wireless sensor networks (MAEF) to plan itineraries for MAs. This can be achieved by grouping nodes in clusters and planning itineraries efficiently among cluster heads (CHs) only. What is more, an alternative itinerary is planned in case of node(s) failure. The simulation result clearly shows that our novel approach performs better than the existing ones.",

                "Résumé": "Recently, mobile agents use in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for data aggregation has acquired considerable attention. In client-server, sensor nodes (SNs) collect data and transmitted back to the base station or sink and thus consuming sensor nodes energy and surcharge the network bandwidth. Software entities called mobile agents (MAs) migrate among SNs in parallel for data collection, and then send this data back to the sink. It has been proven that itinerary planning for MAs in this paradigm is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, many solutions have been proposed to solve this problem. This paper, presents a novel itinerary planning algorithm for MAs based on cluster heads (CHs). In our proposed approach, instead of planning itinerary among all SNs, we plan itinerary just among CHs. First, we group SNs in clusters based on density of SNs then select some SNs as CHs. Second, we plan itineraries for MAs just among CHs based on minimum spanning tree algorithm (MST). At the end, we dispatch an optimal number of MAs for data collection and gathering from CHs. Simulation result shows that our MA Protocol based Energy aware data aggregation (MAPE) for WSNs performs better than previous proposed approaches. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

                "Résumé": "In IEEE 802.11 standard, the wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) provides transmission fairness to nodes in a network, but some nodes that called misbehaving nodes (MNs) can take advantage and modify its MAC parameters to improve its own performance at the expense of other nodes (honest nodes HNs). Many solutions have been proposed to solve this problem, but most of these solutions are based on the assumption that MNs misbehave just one time. Therefor, in this paper, we propose a boycott based enhanced correction scheme for mac layer misbehavior in wireless networks to correct and react against MNs and increasing the HNs throughput. To correct these MNs, HNs collectively react and correct the MNs. When the misbehavior is detected for the first time, HNs react in an appropriate way by decreasing the throughput of MNs, but if MNs misbehave for the second time HNs start to react aggressively and consequently decrease MNs throughput dramatically. In the third misbehavior, HNs boycott the MNs and reject all messages that came from these nodes. Simulation result shows the efficiency of our proposed scheme to improve HNs throughput and boycott MNs. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

                "Résumé": "In this paper, we present an enhanced scheme to handle MAC layer misbehavior in wireless networks. It's known that IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN medium access control (MAC) provides transmission fairness to nodes in a network. But some nodes can take advantage and modify its MAC to improve its own performance at the expense of other nodes. To handle these misbehaving nodes, we use a backslide strategy to react against the misbehaving nodes, which is based on the number of times the misbehaving nodes they misbehave. Extensive simulation results are presented to validate our proposed strategy by improving honest nodes throughput and then the performance of the network.",

                "Résumé": "Big data has fundamentally changed the way organizations manage, analyze and leverage data in any industry. One of the most promising fields where big data can be applied to make a change is healthcare. Big healthcare data has considerable potential to improve patient outcomes, predict outbreaks of epidemics, gain valuable insights, avoid preventable diseases, reduce the cost of healthcare delivery and improve the quality of life in general. However, deciding on the allowable uses of data while preserving security and patient's right to privacy is a difficult task. Big data, no matter how useful for the advancement of medical science and vital to the success of all healthcare organizations, can only be used if security and privacy issues are addressed. To ensure a secure and trustworthy big data environment, it is essential to identify the limitations of existing solutions and envision directions for future research. In this paper, we have surveyed the state-of-the-art security and privacy challenges in big data as applied to healthcare industry, assessed how security and privacy issues occur in case of big healthcare data and discussed ways in which they may be addressed. We mainly focused on the recently proposed methods based on anonymization and encryption, compared their strengths and limitations, and envisioned future research directions.",

Big data is characterized by data that have a large volume, massive velocity, numerous variety, useful value, and veracity. Big Data Analytics offers tremendous insights to different organizations especially in healthcare. Currently, Big healthcare data has the highest potential for improving patient outcomes, gaining valuable insights, predicting outbreaks of epidemics, avoiding preventable diseases and effectively minimizing the cost of healthcare delivery.\nHowever, the dynamic nature of health data presents various conceptual, technical, legal and ethical challenges associated with the data processing and analysis activities. The big data security and privacy concepts are some of the most pertinent issues and have become increasingly significant associated with big healthcare data in the modern world.\nIn this paper, we give an overview of big data characteristics and challenges in healthcare and present big healthcare data lifecycle integrated with security threats and attacks to provide encompass policies and mechanisms that aim at solving the various security challenges in each step of big data lifecycle. The focus is also placed on the description of the recently proposed techniques related to authentication, encryption, anonymization, access control, and privacy. We finally propose an approach to secure threat model for big healthcare data lifecycle as a main contribution of this paper. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

While this data is being hailed as the key to improving health outcomes, gain valuable insights and lowering costs, the security and privacy issues are so overwhelming that healthcare industry is unable to take full advantage of it with its current resources. Managing and harnessing the analytical power of big data, however, is vital to the success of all healthcare organizations. It is in this context that this paper aims to present the state-of-the-art security and privacy issues in big data as applied to healthcare industry and discuss some available data privacy, data security, users accessing mechanisms and strategies.

However, the amount of leukotriene C4 produced by the adult rat median eminences was lower than that produced by the immature rat median eminences. Analysis of the prostaglandin E2 binding parameters of hypothalamic P2 membrane fractions indicates that there are two binding components, one high affinity (R(H)) and one low affinity (R(L)) in both adult and immature rats. The maximal binding capacity of RHfrom adult rat membranes was significantly lower than that of immature rat membranes, correlating with greater prostagladin E2 production by the adult rat median eminence. Only one leukotriene C4 binding site was detected in both adult and immature rat membranes. Exogenous prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene C4 both stimulated, the release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone to the same extent from both the adult and immature median eminences.",

The following studies were performed to determine whether there were any changes in the hypothalamic PGE2 binding and/or PGE2 content which were specific to proestrus and not to the rest of the estrous cycle. Groups of female Wistar rats were sacrificed at 3-h intervals throughout the estrous cycle to determine both the circadian and circaestral changes in the hypothalamic PGE2 content and [3H]PGE2 binding. The hypothalamic PGE2 content was maximal at 1700 h on each of the 4 consecutive days of the estrous cycle but was independent of the stage of the cycle. [3H]PGE2 binding also displayed a circadian rhythm; the lowest binding occurred near the circadian peak of PGE2, suggesting that the PGE2 binding sites were occupied by endogenous PGE2. Since such circadian rhythms were not observed in the hypothalamus of male rats, they may be under the control of ovarian steroids. Also, since PGE2 binding and the PGE2 content both exhibit a diurnal pattern independent of the day of the cycle, there may be changes in the PGE2 receptor-mediated process coupled to an adenylyl cyclase which could explain the luteinizing hormone surge in proestrus.",

The adenylyl cyclase activity in rat hypothalamus synaptic membrane preparations was stimulated by PGE2 and this stimulation was directly related to the presence of guanine nucleotide (GTP). PGE2 specifically bound to P2 membranes from rat and porcine hypothalami with similar characteristics. Computer-fitted saturation curves provided evidence for two binding components which may be two states of the same receptor (RH and RL). Experiments with Gpp(NH)p, a non-metabolizable analogue to GTP, suggested the interconversion of RH and RL. These results may reflect different states of the ternary complex (hormone-receptor-guanine binding protein). Magnesium (Mg2+) can modify the RH and RL binding parameters, but seems to act directly on the PGE2 receptor site.",

                "Résumé": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost every country causing devastating economic and social disruption and stretching healthcare systems to the limit. Furthermore, while being the current gold standard, existing test methods including NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests), clinical analysis of chest CT (Computer Tomography) scan images, and blood test results, require in-person visits to a hospital which is not an adequate way to control such a highly contagious pandemic. Therefore, top priority must be given, among other things, to enlisting recent and adequate technologies to reduce the adverse impact of this pandemic. Modern smartphones possess a rich variety of embedded MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems) sensors capable of recording movements, temperature, audio, and video of their carriers. This study leverages the smartphone sensors for the preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19. Deep learning, an important breakthrough in the domain of artificial intelligence in the past decade, has huge potential for extracting apt and appropriate features in healthcare. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents a new framework that leverages advanced machine learning and data analytics techniques for the early detection of coronavirus disease using smartphone embedded sensors. The proposal provides a simple to use and quickly deployable screening tool that can be easily configured with a smartphone. Experimental results indicate that the model can detect positive cases with an overall accuracy of 79% using only the data from the smartphone sensors. This means that the patient can either be isolated or treated immediately to prevent further spread, thereby saving more lives. The proposed approach does not involve any medical tests and is a cost-effective solution that provides robust results.",

IoT smart medical devices along with wearables are generating and communicating high volume and high-velocity of heterogeneous data. Consequently, services provided by traditional methods such as cloud computing to manage these data become insufficient. Fog computing is seen as being the most effective solution for IoT-based healthcare. The stringy demand of this model was principally driven by a growing need for real-time analysis and low latency.\nIt is apparently envisioned that the medicine field expects to draw enormous interest in combining IoT and fog computing. This in turn, improved the patient treatment, staff satisfaction, and operational efficiency and showed positive influence on all aspects of healthcare.\nThis paper has reviewed fog computing in the context of medical IoT while comparing it with cloud computing and has attempted to present the three-layer architecture of fog-based healthcare system containing: edge, fog and cloud. It has also highlighted challenges facing IoT-driven healthcare in an ever-changing world.",

                "Résumé": "Assured deletion of outsourced data in cloud storage is one of the most important issues in cloud storage. The use of encryption is a promising approach to address this issue. In this paper, we propose a design to achieve assured deletion in cloud storage built upon identity based cryptography (IBE). Compared with other designs known in the literature, foremost among them being FADE, the proposed design comes with a lightweight key management infrastructure. Furthermore, it offers other key management benefits inherent in identity-based cryptography such as key delegation and revocation. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed design, we implement a fully featured prototype and evaluate its performance. Results analysis shows that the overhead time cost of the proposed design does not exceed 3 percent of the plaintext design. This rate decreases significantly for files with larger sizes, which makes it a relevant choice for use in real applications.",

One of the most promising fields where big data can be applied to make a change is healthcare. Big healthcare data has considerable potential to improve patient outcomes, predict outbreaks of epidemics, gain valuable insights, avoid preventable diseases, reduce the cost of healthcare delivery and improve the quality of life in general. However, deciding on the allowable uses of data while preserving security and patient's right to privacy is a difficult task. Big data, no matter how useful for the advancement of medical science and vital to the success of all healthcare organizations, can only be used if security and privacy issues are addressed. To ensure a secure and trustworthy big data environment, it is essential to identify the limitations of existing solutions and envision directions for future research. In this paper, we have surveyed the state-of-the-art security and privacy challenges in big data as applied to healthcare industry, assessed how security and privacy issues occur in case of big healthcare data and discussed ways in which they may be addressed. We mainly focused on the recently proposed methods based on anonymization and encryption, compared their strengths and limitations, and envisioned future research directions.",

Big data is characterized by data that have a large volume, massive velocity, numerous variety, useful value, and veracity. Big Data Analytics offers tremendous insights to different organizations especially in healthcare. Currently, Big healthcare data has the highest potential for improving patient outcomes, gaining valuable insights, predicting outbreaks of epidemics, avoiding preventable diseases and effectively minimizing the cost of healthcare delivery.\nHowever, the dynamic nature of health data presents various conceptual, technical, legal and ethical challenges associated with the data processing and analysis activities. The big data security and privacy concepts are some of the most pertinent issues and have become increasingly significant associated with big healthcare data in the modern world.\nIn this paper, we give an overview of big data characteristics and challenges in healthcare and present big healthcare data lifecycle integrated with security threats and attacks to provide encompass policies and mechanisms that aim at solving the various security challenges in each step of big data lifecycle. The focus is also placed on the description of the recently proposed techniques related to authentication, encryption, anonymization, access control, and privacy. We finally propose an approach to secure threat model for big healthcare data lifecycle as a main contribution of this paper. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

In this paper, we introduce the CS-IBE design based upon ID-based encryption, that aims to strengthen the sensitive data confidentiality in public cloud storage. The CS-IBE design associates files with at least one file access policies, namely the user identity (ID) that will be used as the encryption key. Files are encrypted with the user identity key before outsourcing them to cloud storage side which will add a security layer to the outsourced data. Furthermore, CS-IBE works as an overlay system atop cloud storage solutions. In order to evaluate its security and efficiency, a CS-IBE's prototype design is implemented and analyzed. The obtained results give insights into the provided confidentiality regarding the trade-off performance while simplifying the processes of keys management. The statistical study showed that the overhead cost-time of the proposed design is insignificant especially for large file sizes. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

                "Résumé": "In this study, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the cytotoxicity of three glucocorticoids, namely Hydrocortisone, Dexamethasone, and Methylprednisolone, using three different human cell lines: MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 (both adenocarcinoma cell lines), and HEK293 (kidney epithelial cell line). At lower concentrations exceeding 50 mu M, we did not observe any significant toxic effects of these glucocorticoids. However, when exposed to higher concentrations, Hydrocortisone exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on all three cell lines, with calculated IC50 values of 12 +/- 0.6 mM for HEK293, 2.11 +/- 0.05 mM for MDA-MB-231, and 2.73 +/- 0.128 mM for MCF-7 cells after 48 h of exposure. Notably, Hydrocortisone, at its respective IC50 concentrations, demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of the cancer cell lines, as evidenced by a substantial reduction in BrdU absorbance in a dose-dependent manner, coupled with a markedly reduced rate of colony formation in treated cells. Furthermore, Hydrocortisone exhibited remarkable anti-migratory properties in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, and it induced cell cycle arrest in the SubG1 phase in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition to these effects, Hydrocortisone triggered apoptosis in both cancer cell types, leading to observable morphological changes. This apoptotic response was characterized by a significant increase in the activity of caspase-3, which was time-dependent. Additionally, Hydrocortisone downregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. In summary, our findings underscore the safety of clinical doses in terms of cell toxicity meanwhile increased concentration were showing an anti-proliferative potential of Hydrocortisone, particularly against adenocarcinoma breast cancer cell lines.",

In this paper, we investigate the influence of the parameters of the exciting current pulse on the residual magnetization of a hard steel. In the case of a pulse of long duration and small amplitude, we show that the associated hysteresis problem can be reduced to the determination of a magnetic field distribution due to a fixed magnetization. We define this magnetic field distribution by means of a boundary integral equations method. For these conditions, the internal and external induction distributions are of the same order of magnitude. In contrast, for pulses of short duration (millisecond or less) and large amplitude, the eddy currents in hard steel lead to a remanent magnetization loop which is permanently trapped by the hysteresis phenomena. The residual external induction is always small, and is not representative of the large internal magnetization. (C) 1996 American Institute of Physics.",
